UIST '99: Proceedings of the 12th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,Generalized and stationary scrolling,"We present a generalized definition of scrolling that unifies a wide range of existing interaction techniques, from conventional scrolling through pan and zoom systems and fish-eye views. Furthermore it suggests a useful class of new scrolling techniques in which objects do not move across the display. These “stationary scrolling” techniques do not exhibit either of two problems that plague spatial scrolling system: discontinuity in salience and the undermining of the user's spatial memory.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/320719.322577

The level of detail of the view of any widget component and its children, as well as the responsiveness of that component to the user's actions, can be tuned to the current visible size of that component on the screen.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/320719.322578
UIST '99: Proceedings of the 12th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,Alternative interfaces for chat,"We describe some common problems experienced by users of computer-based text chat, and show how many of these problems relate to the loss of timing-specific information. We suggest that thinking of chat as a real-time streaming media data type, with status and channel indicators, might solve some of these problems. We then present a number of alternative chat interfaces along with results from user studies comparing and contrasting them both with each other and with the standard chat interface. These studies show some potential, but indicate that more work needs to be done.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/320719.322579
UIST '99: Proceedings of the 12th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,Supporting awareness and interaction through collaborative virtual interfaces,"This paper explores interfaces to virtual environments supporting multiple users. An interface to an environment allowing interaction with virtual artefacts is constructed, drawing on previous proposals for 'desktop' virtual environments. These include the use of Peripheral Lenses to support peripheral awareness in collaboration; and extending the ways in which users' actions are represented for each other. Through a qualitative analysis of a design task, the effect of the proposals is outlined. Observations indicate that, whilst these designs go some way to re-constructing physical co-presence in terms of awareness and interaction through the environment, some issues remain. Notably, peripheral distortion in supporting awareness may cause problematic interactions with and through the virtual world; and extended representations of actions may still allow problems in re-assembling the composition of others' actions. We discuss the potential for: designing representations for distorted peripheral perception; and explicitly displaying the course of action in object-focused interaction.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/320719.322580
UIST '99: Proceedings of the 12th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,PeopleGarden: creating data portraits for users,"Many on-line interaction environments have a large number of users. It is difficult for the participants, especially new ones, to form a clear mental image about those with whom they are interacting. How can we compactly convey information about these participants to each other? We propose the <i>data portrait</i>, a novel graphical representation of users based on their past interactions. Data portraits can inform users about each other and the overall social environment. We use a flower metaphor for creating individual data portraits, and a garden metaphor for combining these portraits to represent an on-line environment. We will review previous work in visualizing both individuals and groups. We will then describe our visualizations, explain how to create them, and show how they can be used to address user questions.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/320719.322581
UIST '99: Proceedings of the 12th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,Time-machine computing: a time-centric approach for the information environment,"This paper describes the concept of <i>Time-Machine Computing (TMC)</i>, a time-centric approach to organizing information on computers. A system based on Time-Machine Computing allows a user to visit the past and the future states of computers. When a user needs to refer to a document that he/she was working on at some other time, he/she can travel in the time dimension and the system restores the computer state at that time. Since the user's activities on the system are automatically archived, the user's daily workspace is seamlessly integrated into the information archive. The combination of spatial information management of the desktop metaphor and time traveling allows a user to organize and archive information without being bothered by folder hierarchies or the file classification problems that are common in today's desktop environments. TMC also provides a mechanism for linking multiple applications and external information sources by exchanging time information. This paper describes the key features of TMC, a time-machine desktop environment called “TimeScape,” and several time-oriented application integration examples.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/320719.322582
UIST '99: Proceedings of the 12th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,Using properties for uniform interaction in the Presto document system,"Most document or information management systems rely on hierarchies to organise documents (e.g. files, email messages or web bookmarks). However, the rigid structures of hierarchical schemes do not mesh well with the more fluid nature of everyday document practices. This paper describes Presto, a prototype system that allows users to organise their documents entirely in terms of the properties those documents hold for users. Properties provide a uniform mechanism for managing, coding, searching, retrieving and interacting with documents. We concentrate in particular on the challenges that property-based approaches present and the architecture we have developed to tackle them.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/320719.322583
UIST '99: Proceedings of the 12th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,Synchronizing clipboards of multiple computers,"This paper describes a new technique for transferring data between computers, the <i>synchronized clipboard</i>. Multiple computers can share a synchronized clipboard for all clipboard operations, so that data copied to the clipboard from one computer, using the standard Copy command, can be pasted directly on another computer using the standard Paste command. Synchronized clipboards are well-suited for a single user moving data among several computers in close proximity. We describe an implementation of synchronized clipboards that works across a wide range of existing systems, including 3Com PalmPilots, Microsoft Windows PCs, Unix workstations, and other Java-capable platforms. Our implementation adds no noticeable overhead to local copy and paste operations.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/320719.322584
UIST '99: Proceedings of the 12th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,Implementing phicons: combining computer vision with infrared technology for interactive physical icons,"This paper describes a novel physical icon [3] (“phicon”) based system that can be programmed to issue a range of commands about what the user wishes to do with handdrawn whiteboard content. Through the phicon's UI, a command to process whiteboard context is issued using infrared signaling in combination with image processing and a ceiling-mounted camera system. We leverage camera systems that are already used for capturing whiteboard content [4] by further augmenting these systems to detect the presence and location of IR beacons within an image. An HDLC-based protocol and a built-in IR transmitter are used to send these signals.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/320719.322585

Our approach consists of human-human dialogue analysis, and computational modeling of dialogue.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/320719.322586
UIST '99: Proceedings of the 12th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,Building virtual structures with physical blocks,"We describe a tangible interface for building virtual structures using physical building blocks.

In another version, buildings created with our blocks are rendered in different styles, using intelligent decoration of the building model.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/320719.322587
UIST '99: Proceedings of the 12th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,Constraint cascading style sheets for the Web,"Cascading Style Sheets have been introduced by the W3C as a mechanism for controlling the appearance of HTML documents. In this paper, we demonstrate how constraints provide a powerful unifying formalism for declaratively understanding and specifying style sheets for web documents. With constraints we can naturally and declaratively specify complex behavior such as inheritance of properties and cascading of conflicting style rules. We give a detailed description of a constraint-based style sheet model, CCSS, which is compatible with virtually all of the CSS 2.0 specification. It allows more flexible specification of layout, and also allows the designer to provide multiple layouts that better meet the desires of the user and environmental restrictions. We also describe a prototype extension of the Amaya browser that demonstrates the feasibility of CCSS.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/320719.322588
UIST '99: Proceedings of the 12th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,Reducing the storage requirements of constraint dataflow graphs,"Most one-way constraint solvers use directed dataflow graphs to represent the dependencies among variables in a constraint. Unfortunately, dataflow graphs require a great deal of storage. These storage costs can help push a large application into virtual memory, thus significantly degrading interactive performance. Reducing the storage costs of dataflow graphs is therefore an important goal in constraint research. This paper describes a study that makes two contributions to solving this problem:",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/320719.322589
UIST '99: Proceedings of the 12th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,A tool for creating predictive performance models from user interface demonstrations,"A central goal of many user interface development tools has been to make the construction of high quality interfaces easy enough that iterative design approaches could be a practical reality. In the last 15 years significant advances in this regard have been achieved. However, the evaluation portion of the iterative design process has received relatively little support from tools. Even though advances have also been made in usability evaluation methods, nearly all evaluation is still done “by hand,” making it more expensive and difficult than it might be. This paper considers a partial implementation of the CRITIQUE usability evaluation tool that is being developed to help remedy this situation by automating a number of evaluation tasks. This paper will consider techniques used by the system to produce predictive models (keystroke level models and simplified GOMS models) from demonstrations of sample tasks in a fraction of the time needed by conventional handcrafting methods. A preliminary comparison of automatically generated models with models created by an expert modeler show them to produce very similar predictions (within 2%). Further, because they are automated, these models promise to be less subject to human error and less affected by the skill of the modeler.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/320719.322590
UIST '99: Proceedings of the 12th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,The VideoMouse: a camera-based multi-degree-of-freedom input device,"The VideoMouse is a mouse that uses a camera as its input sensor. A real-time vision algorithm determines the six degree-of-freedom mouse posture, consisting of 2D motion, tilt in the forward/back and left/right axes, rotation of the mouse about its vertical axis, and some limited height sensing. Thus, a familiar 2D device can be extended for three-dimensional manipulation, while remaining suitable for standard 2D GUI tasks. We describe techniques for mouse functionality, 3D manipulation, navigating large 2D spaces, and using the camera for lightweight scanning tasks.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/320719.322591
UIST '99: Proceedings of the 12th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,Real-world interaction using the FieldMouse,"We introduce an inexpensive position input device called the <i>FieldMouse</i>, with which a computer can tell the position of the device on paper or any flat surface without using special input tablets or position detection devices. A FieldMouse is a combination of an ID recognizer like a barcode reader and a mouse which detects relative movement of the device. Using a FieldMouse, a user first detects an ID on paper by using the barcode reader, and then drags it from the ID using the mouse. If the location of the ID is known, the location of the dragged FieldMouse can also be calculated by adding the amount of movement from the ID to the position of the FieldMouse. Using a FieldMouse in this way, any flat surface can work as a pointing device that supports absolute position input, just by putting an ID tag somewhere on the surface. A FieldMouse can also be used for enabling a graphical user interface (GUI) on paper or on any flat surface by analyzing the direction and the amount of mouse movement after detecting an ID. In this paper, we introduce how a FieldMouse can be used in various situations to enable computing in real-world environments.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/320719.322592
UIST '99: Proceedings of the 12th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,Personalizing the capture of public experiences,"In this paper, we describe our work on developing a system to support the personalization of a captured public experience. Specifically, we are interested in providing students with the ability to personalize the capture of the lecture experiences as part of the Classroom 2000 project. We discuss the issues and challenges involved in designing a system that performs live integration of personal streams of information with multiple other streams of information made available to it through an environment designed to capture public information.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/320719.322593
UIST '99: Proceedings of the 12th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,ActiveText: a method for creating dynamic and interactive texts,"This paper describes ActiveText, a method for creating dynamic and interactive texts. ActiveText uses an object-based hierarchy to represent texts. This hierarchy makes it easy to work with the ASCII component and pixel component of the text at the same time. Static, dynamic and interactive properties of text can be easily intermixed and layered. The user can enter and edit text, adjust static and dynamic layout, apply dynamic and interactive behaviors, and adjust their parameters with a common set of tools and a common interface. Support for continuous editing allows the user to sketch dynamically. A prototype application called <i>It's Alive!</i> has been implemented to explore the ActiveText functionality. The documents produced by <i>It's Alive!</i> can be of use in a wide-range of areas, including chat-spaces, email, web-sites, fiction and poetry writing, and low-end film &amp; video titling.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/320719.322594
UIST '99: Proceedings of the 12th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,The information percolator: ambient information display in a decorative object,"Most current interface designs require that the user focus their attention on them in order to be of value. However, as the price of computation falls, and computational capabilities make their way into many everyday objects, the demand for attention from many different directions may begin to seriously reduce the usefulness of these computational objects. Ambient information displays are intended to fit in a part of the interface design space that does not have this property. They are designed to convey background or context information that the user may or may not wish to attend to at any given time. Ambient Displays are designed to work primarily in the periphery of a user's awareness, moving to the center of attention only when appropriate and desirable. This paper describes a new ambient information display that is designed to give a rich medium of expression placed within an aesthetically pleasing decorative object. This display — the <i>Information Percolator</i> — is formed by air bubbles rising up tubes of water. By properly controlling the release of air, a set of pixels which scroll up the display is created. This allows a rendition of any (small, black and white) image to be displayed. The detailed design and construction of this display device will be considered, along with several applications.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/320719.322595
UIST '99: Proceedings of the 12th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,Sketching with projective 2D strokes,"Freehand sketching has long had appeal as an artistic medium for conceptual design because of its immediacy in capturing and communicating design intent and visual experience. We present a sketching paradigm that supports the early stages of design by preserving the fluidity of traditional freehand drawings. In addition, it attempts to fill the gap between 2D drawing programs, which have fixed views, and 3D modeling programs that allow arbitrary views. We implement our application as a two-dimensional drawing program that utilizes a projective representation of points — i.e. points that lie on the surface of a unit sphere centered at the viewpoint. This representation facilitates the production of novel re-projections generated from an initial perspective sketch and gives the user the impression of being immersed in the drawing or space. We describe a method for aligning a sketch drawn outside the system using its vanishing points, allowing the integration of computer sketching and freehand sketching on paper in an iterative manner. The user interface provides a virtual camera, projective grids to guide in the construction of proportionate scenes, and the ability to underlay sketches with other drawings or photographic panoramas.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/320719.322596
UIST '99: Proceedings of the 12th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,Integrated manipulation: context-aware manipulation of 2D diagrams,"Diagram manipulation in conventional CAD systems requires frequent mode switching and explicit placement of the pivot for rotation and scaling. In order to simplify this process, we propose an interaction technique called <i>integrated manipulation</i>, where the user can move, rotate, and scale without mode switching. In addition, the pivot for rotation and scaling automatically snaps to a contact point during moving operation. We performed a user study is performed using our prototype system and a commercial CAD system. The results showed that users could perform a diagram manipulation task much more rapidly using our technique.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/320719.322597
UIST '99: Proceedings of the 12th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,Digital tape drawing,"Tape drawing is the art of creating sketches on large scale upright surfaces using black photographic tape. Typically used in the automotive industry, it is an important part of the automotive design process that is currently not computerized. We analyze and describe the unique aspects of tape drawing, and use this knowledge to design and implement a digital tape drawing system. Our system retains the fundamental interaction and visual affordances of the traditional media while leveraging the power of the digital media. Aside from the practical aspect of our work, the interaction techniques developed have interesting implications for current theories of human bimanual interaction.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/320719.322598
UIST '99: Proceedings of the 12th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,The role of kinesthetic reference frames in two-handed input performance,"We present experimental work which explores how the match (or mismatch) between the input space of the hands and the output space of a graphical display influences two-handed input performance. During interaction with computers, a direct correspondence between the input and output spaces is often lacking. Not only are the hands disjoint from the display space, but the reference frames of the hands may in fact be disjoint from one another if two separate input devices (e.g. two mice) are used for two-handed input. In general, we refer to the workspace and origin within which the hands operate as <i>kinesthetic reference frames</i>. Our goal is to better understand how an interface designer's choice of kinesthetic reference frames influences a user's ability to coordinate two-handed movements, and to explore how the answer to this question may depend on the availability of visual feedback. Understanding this issue has implications for the design of two-handed interaction techniques and input devices, as well as for the reference principle of Guiard's Kinematic Chain model of human bimanual action. Our results suggest that the Guiard reference principle is robust with respect to variances in the kinesthetic reference frames as long as appropriate visual feedback is present.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/320719.322599
UIST '99: Proceedings of the 12th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,Linking and messaging from real paper in the Paper PDA,"It is well known that paper is a very fluid, natural, and easy to use medium for manipulating some kinds of information. It is familiar, portable, flexible, inexpensive, and offers good readability properties. Paper also has well known limitations when compared with electronic media. Work in hybrid paper electronic interfaces seeks to bring electronic capabilities to real paper in order to obtain the best properties of each. This paper describes a hybrid paper electronic system — the <i>Paper PDA</i> — which is designed to allow electronic capabilities to be employed within a conventional paper notebook, calendar, or organizer. The Paper PDA is based on a simple observation: a paper notebook can be synchronized with a body of electronic information much like an electronic PDA can be synchronized with information hosted on a personal computer. This can be accomplished by scanning, recognizing and processing its contents, then printing a new copy. This paper introduces the Paper PDA concept and considers interaction techniques and applications designed to work within the Paper PDA. The <i>StickerLink</i> technique supports on-paper hyperlinking using removable paper stickers. Two applications are also considered which look at aspects of electronic communications via the Paper PDA.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/320719.322600
UIST '99: Proceedings of the 12th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,WEST: a Web browser for small terminals,"We describe WEST, a WEb browser for Small Terminals, that aims to solve some of the problems associated with accessing web pages on hand-held devices. Through a novel combination of text reduction and focus+context visualization, users can access web pages from a very limited display environment, since the system will provide an overview of the contents of a web page even when it is too large to be displayed in its entirety. To make maximum use of the limited resources available on a typical hand-held terminal, much of the most demanding work is done by a proxy server, allowing the terminal to concentrate on the task of providing responsive user interaction. The system makes use of some interaction concepts reminiscent of those defined in the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), making it possible to utilize the techniques described here for WAP-compliant devices and services that may become available in the near future.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/320719.322601

UIST '94: Proceedings of the 7th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,Creating the invisible interface: (invited talk),"For thirty years, most interface design, and most computer design, has been headed down the path of the “dramatic” machine.  Its highest ideal is to make a computer so exciting, so wonderful so interesting, that we never want to be without it.  A less-traveled path I call the “invisible”; its highest ideal is to make a computer so imbedded, so fitting, so natural, that we use it without even thinking about it.  (I have also called this notion “Ubiquitous Computing.”) I believe that in the next twenty years the second path will come to dominate.  But this will not be easy; very little of our current systems infrastructure will survive.  We have been building versions of the infrastructure-to-come at PARC for the past four years, in the form of inch-, foot-, and yard-sized computers we call Tabs, Pads, and Boards.  In this talk I will describe the humanistic origins of the “invisible” ideal in post-modernist thought.  I will then describe some of our prototypes, how they succeed and fail to be invisible, and what we have learned.  I will illustrate new systems issues that user interface designers will face when creating invisibility.  And I will indicate some new directions we are now exploring, including the famous “dangling string” display.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/192426.192428
UIST '94: Proceedings of the 7th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,Galaxy of news: an approach to visualizing and understanding expansive news landscapes,"The Galaxy of News system embodies an approach to visualizing large quantities of independently authored pieces of information, in this case news stories.  At the heart of this system is a powerful relationship construction engine that constructs an associative relation network to automatically build implicit links between related articles.  To visualize these relationships, and hence the news information space, the Galaxy of News uses pyramidal structuring and visual presentation, semantic zooming and panning, animated visual cues that are dynamically constructed to illustrate relationships between articles, and fluid interaction in a three dimensional information space to browse and search through large databases of news articles.  The result is a tool that allows people to quickly  gain a broad understanding of a news base by providing an abstracted presentation that covers the entire information base, and through interaction, progressively refines the details of the information space.  This research has been generalized into a model for news access and visualization to provide automatic construction of news information spaces and derivation of an interactive news experience.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/192426.192429

The essence of our approach is to lay out the hierarchy uniformly on the hyperbolic plane and map this plane onto a circular display region.  The projection onto the disk provides a natural mechanism for assigning more space to a portion of the hierarchy while still embedding it in a much larger context.  Change of focus is accomplished by translating the structure on the hyperbolic plane, which allows a smooth transition without compromising the presentation of the context.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/192426.192430

Clearly such tasks can never be automated fully, but few existing tools offer support for mechanising more than the simplest repetitive aspects of the search.  <i>Reconnaissance</i> facilities, in which the computer produces summary reports from exploration in directions suggested by the user, can save the user time and effort by revealing which areas are the most deserving of detailed investigation.

UIST '94: Proceedings of the 7th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,Putting people first: specifying proper names in speech interfaces,"Communication is about people, not machines.  But as firms and families alike spread out geographically, we rely increasingly on telecommunications tools to keep us “connected”. The challenge of such systems is to enable conversation between individuals without computational infrastructure getting in the way.  This paper compares two speech-based communication systems, Phoneshell and Chatter, in how they deal with the keys to communication: proper names.  Chatter, a conversational system using speech-recognition, improves upon the hierarchical nature of the touch-tone based Phoneshell by maintaining context and enabling use of anaphora.  Proper names can present particular problems for speech recognizers, so an interface algorithm for reliable name specification by  spelling is offered.  Since individual letter recognition is non-robust, Chatter implicitly disambiguates strings of letters based on context.  We hypothesize that the right interface can make faulty speech recognition as usable as TouchTones—even more so.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/192426.192439

Applications are created by designing the interface with a GUI-builder and embedding callback code in an interpreted language, in much the same way as one would build a traditional (non-distributed, single-user) application with a modern user interface development environment. The resulting application can be run from within the GUI-builder for rapid turnaround or as a stand-alone executable. The Visual Obliq runtime provides abstractions and support for issues specific to distributed computing, such as replication, sharing, communication, and session management.

The interactivity also allows users to change the map and add icon annotations.

This study proposes a system which generates GUIs by generalizing multiple sets of application data and its visualization examples.

Using stochastic methods such as simulated annealing and genetic algorithms, automatic layout systems can find a good layout using an evaluation function which can calculate how good a given layout is. However, the evaluation function is usually not known beforehand, and it might vary from user to user. In our system, users show the system several pairs of good and bad layout examples, and the system infers the evaluation function from the examples using genetic programming technique. After the evaluation function evolves to reflect the preferences of the user, it is used as a general evaluation function for laying out graphs. The same technique can be used for a wide range of adaptive user interface systems.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/192426.192468

Time-based information, in particular, is an important part of many information access tasks. This paper explores how to use 3D graphics and interactive animation to design and implement visualizers that improve access to large masses of time-based information. Two new visualizers have been developed for the Information Visualizer: 1) the Spiral Calendar was designed for rapid access to an individual's daily schedule, and 2) the Time Lattice was designed for analyzing the time relationships among the schedules of groups of people. The Spiral Calendar embodies a new 3D graphics technique for integrating detail and context by placing objects in a 3D spiral. It demonstrates that advanced graphics techniques can enhance routine office information tasks. The Time Lattice is formed by aligning a collection of 2D calendars. 2D translucent shadows provide views and interactive access to the resulting complex 3D object. The paper focuses on how these visualizations were developed. The Spiral Calendar, in particular, has gone through an entire cycle of development, including design, implementation, evaluation, revision and reuse.

UIST '94: Proceedings of the 7th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,Optimizing toolkit-generated graphical interfaces,"Researchers have developed a variety of toolkits that support the development of highly interactive, graphical, direct manipulation applications such as animations, process monitoring tools, drawing packages, visual programming languages, games, and data and program visualization systems. These toolkits contain many useful features such as 1) structured graphics, 2) automatic display management, 3) constraints, and 4) high-level input-handling models. Despite a number of optimizations that have been described in the literature, most toolkit-generated applications run in a predominantly interpreted mode at runtime: they dynamically determine the set of constraints and objects that must be redisplayed, which requires the use of time consuming algorithms and data structures. The optimizations that do exist rely on semantic information that applies <i>globally</i> to all operations in an application. In this paper we identify a number of optimizations that require <i>local</i>, operation-specific semantic information about an application. For each operation, these optimizations pre-compute update plans that minimize the number of objects that are examined for redisplay, and pre-compute constraint plans that minimize the amount of dynamic scheduling and method dispatching that is performed for constraint satisfaction. We present performance measurements that suggest that these optimizations can significantly improve the performance of an application.

We focus on the domain of freehand sketch editors, such as an electronic whiteboard application for a pen-based computer. By using computer vision techniques to perform covert recognition of visual structure as it emerges during the course of a drawing/editing session, a perceptually supported image editor gives users access to visual objects as they are perceived by the human visual system. We present a flexible image interpretation architecture based on token grouping in a multiscale blackboard data structure.

Although editing splines by specifying control points and tangents may be appropriate for engineers, graphic designers think more in terms of strokes, shapes, and gestures appropriate for editing drawings. Our interaction technique matches the latter model: curves can be edited by means of marks, similar to the way strokes are naturally overloaded when drawing on paper.

UIST '92: Proceedings of the 5th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,Interactive shadows,"It is often difficult in computer graphics applications to understand spatial relationships between objects in a 3D scene or effect changes to those objects without specialized visualization and manipulation techniques. We present a set of three-dimensional tools (widgets) called “shadows” that not only provide valuable perceptual cues about the spatial relationships between objects, but also provide a direct manipulation interface to constrained transformation techniques. These shadow widgets provide two advances over previous techniques. First, they provide high correlation between their own geometric feedback and their effects on the objects they control. Second, unlike some other 3D widgets, they do not obscure the objects they control.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/142621.142622

This paper discusses the kinds of situations which call for two-handed input and not just the single hand, and reports a prototype in which two-handed gestures serve to input concepts, both static and dynamic, manipulate displayed items, and specify actions to be taken. Future directions include enlargement of the vocabulary of two-handed “coverbal” gestures and the modulation by gaze of gestural intent.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/142621.142623
UIST '92: Proceedings of the 5th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,A testbed for characterizing dynamic response of virtual environment spatial sensors,"This paper describes a testbed and method for characterizing the dynamic response of the type of spatial displacement transducers commonly used in virtual environment (VE) applications. The testbed consists of a motorized rotary swing arm that imparts known displacement inputs to the VE sensor. The experimental method involves a series of tests in which the sensor is displaced back and forth at a number of controlled frequencies that span the bandwidth of volitional human movement. During the tests, actual swing arm angle and reported VE sensor displacements are collected and time stamped. Because of the time stamping technique, the response time of the sensor can be measured directly, independent of latencies in data transmission from the sensor unit and any processing by the  interface applications running on the host computer. Analysis of these experimental results allows sensor time delay and gain characteristics to be determined as a function of input frequency. Results from tests of several differnt VE spatial sensors (Ascension, Logitech, and Polhemus) are presented here to demonstrate use of the testbed and method.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/142621.142624

It focuses on retrieval of application objects as its top level mechanism for accessing user information, documents, or services. We have embodied the InfoGrid design in an object-oriented application framework that supports rapid construction of applications. This application framework has been used to build a number of applications, some that are classically characterized as information retrieval applications, others that are more typically viewed as personal work tools.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/142621.142625

Our frameworks, called visual formalisms, provide the semantic structures and editing operations, as well as the visual layout algorithms, needed to create a complete application. Examples of visual formalisms include tables, panels, graphs, and outlines. They are designed to be extended both by programmers, through subclassing, and by end users, through an integrated extension language.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/142621.142626
UIST '92: Proceedings of the 5th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,An explanatory and “argumentative” interface for a model-based diagnostic system,"That intelligent systems need an explanatory capability if they are to aid or support human users has long been understood. A system which can justify its decisions generally obtains improved user trust, greater accuracy in use and offers embedded training potential. Extensive work has been done to provide rule-based systems with explanatory interfaces, but little has been done to provide the same benefits for model-based systems. We develop an approach to organizing the presentation of large amounts of model-based data in an interactive format patterned after a model of human-human explanatory and argumentative discourse. Portions of this interface were implemented for Honeywell's model-based Flight Control Maintenance and Diagnostic System (FCMDS). We conclude that sufficient information exists in a model-based system to provide a wide range of explanation types, and that, the discourse approach is a convenient, powerful and broadly applicable method of organizing and controlling information exchange involving this data.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/142621.142627

Recently, however, single-chip digital signal processors have made real-time spatial audio an affordable possibility for many workstations. This paper describes an efficient spatialization technique and the associated computational requirements. Issues specific to the use of spatial audio in user interfaces are addressed.

The primary motivation for this work is to provide accessibility to graphical applications for users who are blind or visually impaired. We describe the design of an auditory interface which simulates many of the features of graphical interfaces. We then describe the architecture we have built to model and transform graphical interfaces.

A multimedia application, for example, may play and record audio, use speech recognition input, and use a window system for graphical I/O. The software architecture of such a system can be simplified if the application communicates to multiple servers (e.g., audio servers, recognition servers) that each manage different types of input and output. This paper describes tools for rapidly prototyping distributed asynchronous servers and applications, with an emphasis on supporting highly interactive user interfaces, temporal media, and multi-modal I/O.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/142621.142630
UIST '92: Proceedings of the 5th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,Some virtues and limitations of action inferring interfaces,"An action inferring facility for a multimodal interface called Edward is described. Based on the actions the user performs, Edward anticipates future actions and offers to perform them automatically. The system uses inductive inference to anticipate actions. It generalizes over arguments and results, and detects patterns on the basis of a small sequence of user actions, e.g. “copy a lisp file; change extension of original file into .org; put the copy in the backup folder”. Multimodality (particularly the combination of natural language and simulated pointing gestures) and the reuse of patterns are important new features. Some possibilities and problems of action inferring interfaces in general are addressed. Action inferring interfaces are particularly useful for professional users of general-purpose applications. Such users are unable to program repetitive patterns because either the applications do not provide the facilities or the users lack the capabilities.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/142621.142631
UIST '92: Proceedings of the 5th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,Adding rule-based reasoning to a demonstrational interface builder,"This paper presents a demonstrational interface builder with improved reasoning capabilities. The system is comprised of two major components: an interactive display manager and a rule-based reasoner. The display manager provides facilities to draw the physical appearance of an interface and define interface behavior by graphical demonstration. The behavior is defined using a technique of stimulus-response demonstrations. With this technique, an interface developer first demonstrates a stimulus that represents an action that an end user will perform on the interface. After the stimulus, the developer demonstrates the response(s) that should result from the given stimulus. As the behavior is demonstrated, the reasoner observes the demonstrations and draws inferences to expedite behavior definition. The inferences entail generalizing from specific behavior demonstrations and identifying constraints that define the generalized behavior. Once behavior constraints are identified, the reasoner sends them to the display manager to complete the definition process. When the interface is executed by an end-user, the display manager uses the constraints to implement the run-time behavior of the interface.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/142621.142632
UIST '92: Proceedings of the 5th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,A history-based macro by example system,"Many tasks performed using computer interfaces are very repetitive. While programmers can write macros or procedures to automate these repetitive tasks, this requires special skills. Demonstrational systems make macro building accessible to all users, but most provide either no visual representation of the macro or only a textual representation. We have developed a history-based visual representation of commands in a graphical user interface. This representation supports the definition of macros by example in several novel ways. At any time, a user can open a history window, review the commands executed in a session, select operations to encapsulate into a macro, and choose objects and their attributes as arguments. The system has facilities to generalize the macro automatically, save it for future use, and edit it.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/142621.142633
UIST '92: Proceedings of the 5th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,Declarative programming of graphical interfaces by visual examples,"Graphical user interfaces (GUI) provide intuitive and easy means for users to communicate with computers. However, construction of GUI software requires complex programming that is far from being intuitive. Because of the “semantic gap” between the textual application program and its graphical interface, the programmer himself must conceptually maintain the correspondence between the textual programming and the graphical image of the resulting interface. Instead, we propose a programming environment based on the <i>programming by visual example</i> (<i>PBVE</i>) scheme, which allows the GUI designers to “program” visual interfaces for their applications by “drawing” the example visualization of application data with a direct  manipulation interface. Our system, TRIP3, realizes this with (1) the <i>bi-directional translation model</i> between the (abstract) application data and the pictorial data of the GUI, and (2) the ability to generate mapping rules for the translation from example application data and its corresponding example visualization. The latter is made possible by the use of <i>generalization of visual examples</i>, where the system is able to automatically generate generalized mapping rules from a given set of examples.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/142621.142634
UIST '92: Proceedings of the 5th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,Graphical styles for building interfaces by demonstration,"Conventional interface builders allow the user interface designer to select widgets such as menus, buttons and scroll bars, and lay them out using a mouse. Although these are conceptually simple to use, in practice there are a number of problems. First, a typical widget will have dozens of properties which the designer might change. Insuring that these properties are consistent across multiple widgets in a dialog box and multiple dialog boxes in an application can be very difficult. Second, if the designer wants to change the properties, each widget must be edited individually. Third, getting the widgets laid out appropriately in a dialog box can be tedious. Grids and alignment commands are not sufficient. This paper describes <i>Graphical Tabs</i> and <i>Graphical  Styles</i> in the Gild interface builder which solve all of these problems. A “graphical tab” is an absolute position in a window. A “graphical style” incorporates both property and layout information, and can be defined by example, named, applied to other widgets, edited, saved to a file, and read from a file. If a graphical style is edited, then all widgets defined using that style are modified. In addition, because appropriate styles are inferred, they do not have to be explicitly applied.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/142621.142635

The marked comments are overlapped and attached to the commented areas. Third, it provides a mechanism to allow users to bring data from more than one source to a single document. The views of the included data can be tailored. Fourth, users can work on an included medium through its embedded view or through another complete and duplicated view. It isolates and simplifies the interface design of individual media editors.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/142621.142639
UIST '92: Proceedings of the 5th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,The role of natural language in a multimodal interface,"Although graphics and direct manipulation are effective interface technologies for some classes of problems, they are limited in many ways. In particular, they provide little support for identifying objects not on the screen, for specifying temporal relations, for identifying and operating on large sets and subsets of entities, and for using the context of interaction. On the other hand, these are precisely strengths of natural language. This paper presents an interface that blends natural language processing and direct manipulation technologies, using each for their characteristic advantages. Specifically, the paper shows how to use natural language to describe objects and temporal relations, and how to use direct manipulation for overcoming hard natural language problems involving  the establishment and use of context and pronominal reference. This work has been implemented in SRI's Shoptalk system, a prototype information and decision-support system for manufacturing.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/142621.142641

The mechanism is implemented in GINA, an object-oriented application framework. Taps maintain a functional mapping from application data to interface objects that is described in a general-purpose programming language. Taps are triggered automatically by user actions. Compared to constraints or the MVC model, taps do not need execution or memory support from the application objects, at the expense of a performance penalty. Screen updates, which pose the largest performance problem, are minimized by checking for attribute changes and window visibility. A comparison operation is used to maintain structural consistency between hierarchies of application and interface objects. Taps can be defined interactively using formulas in a spreadsheet-like tool.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/142621.142648
UIST '92: Proceedings of the 5th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology,Probabilistic state machines: dialog management for inputs with uncertainty,"Traditional models of input work on the assumption that inputs delivered to a system are fairly certain to have occurred as they are reported. However, a number of new input modalities, such as pen-based inputs, hand and body gesture inputs, and voice input, do not share this property. Inputs under these techniques are normally acquired by a process of recognition. As a result, each of these techniques makes mistakes and provides inputs which are approximate or uncertain. This paper considers some preliminry techniques for dialog management in the presence of this uncertainty. These techniques—including a new input model and a set of extended state machine abstractions—will explicitly model uncertainty and handle it as a normal and expected part of the input process.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/142621.142650

UIST '89: Proceedings of the 2nd annual ACM SIGGRAPH symposium on User interface software and technology,Specifying composite illustrations with communicative goals,"IBIS (Intent-Based Illustration System) generates illustrations automatically, guided by communicative goals. Communicative goals specify that particular properties of objects, such as their color, size, or location are to be conveyed in the illustration. IBIS is intended to be part of an interactive multimedia explanation generation system. It has access to a knowledge base that contains a collection of objects, including information about their geometric properties, material, and location. As the goals are interpreted by a rule-based control component, the system generates a precise definition of the final illustration. If IBIS determines that a set of goals cannot be satisfied in a single picture, then it attempts to create a composite illustration that has multiple viewports. For example, a composite illustration may contain a nested inset illustration showing an object in greater detail than is possible in the parent picture. Each component illustration is defined by its placement, size, viewing specification, lighting specification, and list of objects to be displayed and their graphical style.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/73660.73661
UIST '89: Proceedings of the 2nd annual ACM SIGGRAPH symposium on User interface software and technology,The cognitive coprocessor architecture for interactive user interfaces,"The graphics capabilities and speed of current hardware systems allow the exploration of 3D and animation in user interfaces, while improving the degree of interaction as well. In order to fully utilize these capabilities, new software architectures must support multiple, asynchronous, interacting agents (the <i>Multiple Agent Problem</i>), <i>and</i> support smooth interactive animation (the <i>Animation Problem</i>). The <i>Cognitive Coprocessor</i> is a new user interface architecture designed to solve these two problems, while supporting highly interactive user interfaces that have 2D and 3D animations. This architecture includes <i>3D Rooms</i>, a 3D analogy to the Rooms system with Rooms Buttons extended to <i>Interactive Objects</i> that deal with 3D, animation, and gestures.

This paper describes a User Interface Management System (UIMS) based on the data model. The UIMS is capable of maintaining different and simultaneous representations of the same application data objects.

The lack of a standard to represent this information leads to a proliferation of different assumptions by different building blocks, hampering changeability of the user interface and portability of applications to different sets of building blocks. This paper describes a formalism for specifying the information about applications needed by the user interface building blocks (<i>i.e.</i> the <i>UIMS/Application interface</i>) so that all building blocks share a common set of assumptions. The paper also describes a set of user interface building blocks specifically designed for these standard UIMS/Application interfaces.

The programmer chooses application data objects and functions that define the capabilities of the interface. At runtime, an interface design component, implemented as a set of production system rules, transforms this semantic specification into an interface built using a window system, an associated user interface toolkit, and the hardware input devices available on the system. The rules match application requirements against a semantic description of the toolkit, selecting virtual devices for input, output, and layout.

UIST '89: Proceedings of the 2nd annual ACM SIGGRAPH symposium on User interface software and technology,Creating graphical interactive application objects by demonstration,"The Lapidary user interface tool allows <i>all</i> pictorial aspects of programs to be specified graphically. In addition, the behavior of these objects at run-time can be specified using dialogue boxes and by demonstration. In particular, Lapidary allows the designer to draw pictures of application-specific graphical objects which will be created and maintained at run-time by the application. This includes the graphical entities that the end user will manipulate (such as the components of the picture), the feedback that shows which objects are selected (such as small boxes on the sides and corners of an object), and the dynamic feedback objects (such as hair-line boxes to show where an object is being dragged). In addition, Lapidary supports the construction and use of “widgets” (sometimes called interaction techniques or gadgets) such as menus, scroll bars, buttons and icons. Lapidary therefore supports <i>using</i> a pre-defined library of widgets, and <i>defining</i> a new library with a unique “look and feel.” The run-time behavior of all these objects can be specified in a straightforward way using constraints and abstract descriptions of the interactive response to the input devices.

An interface can be restructured by moving entire subtrees as modules. State trees separate the recognition of commands from their implementation, allowing either to be modified independently. State trees structure flow of control within an implementation without imposing an identical structure on the interface itself, which need not be hierarchical.
