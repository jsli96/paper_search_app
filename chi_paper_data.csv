CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Where do web sites come from?: capturing and interacting with design history,"To form a deep understanding of the present; we need to ?nd and engage history. We present an informal history capture and retrieval mechanism for collaborative, early-stage information design. This history system is implemented in the context of the Designers' Outpost, a wall-scale, tangible interface for collaborative web site design. The interface elements in this history system are designed to be ?uid and comfortable for early-phase design. As demonstrated by an informal lab study with six professional designers, this history system enhances the design process itself, and provides new opportunities for reasoning about the design of complex artifacts",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503378
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,The augurscope: a mixed reality interface for outdoors,"The augurscope is a portable mixed reality interface for outdoors. A tripod-mounted display is wheeled to different locations and rotated and tilted to view a virtual environment that is aligned with the physical background. Video from an onboard camera is embedded into this virtual environment. Our design encompasses physical form, interaction and the combination of a GPS receiver, electronic compass, accelerometer and rotary encoder for tracking. An initial application involves the public exploring a medieval castle from the site of its modern replacement. Analysis of use reveals problems with lighting, movement and relating virtual and physical viewpoints, and shows how environmental factors and physical form affect interaction. We suggest that problems might be accommodated by carefully constructing virtual and physical content",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503379
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"Movement model, hits distribution and learning in virtual keyboarding","In a ten-session experiment, six participants practiced typing with an expanding rehearsal method on an optimized virtual keyboard. Based on a large amount of in-situ performance data, this paper reports the following findings. First, the Fitts-digraph movement efficiency model of virtual keyboards is revised. The format and parameters of Fitts' law used previously in virtual keyboards research were incorrect. Second, performance limit predictions of various layouts are calculated with the new model. Third, learning with expanding rehearsal intervals for maximum memory benefits is effective, but many improvements of the training algorithm used can be made in the future. Finally, increased visual load when typing previously practiced text did not significantly change users' performance at this stage of learning, but typing unpracticed text did have a performance effect, suggesting a certain degree of text specific learning when typing on virtual keyboards",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503381
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Comparison of two touchpad-based methods for numeric entry,Small hand-held touchpads can be used to replace stylus-based digitizing tablets when the use of a stylus is not convenient. In text entry tasks where the writing surface is held in a hand the error rate becomes a problem. The small size of strokes compared to the width of the fingertip and the additional imprecision caused by the interaction of the pad and finger movements make input very imprecise. We describe a new improved clock-face based stroke system for entering numbers with a touchpad. In a 20-session user study with 6 users we found slightly better throughput of successfully entered numbers with the proposed new system. This advantage was mainly due to lower error rate with the new system. User preference similarly slightly favored the new system over an earlier straightforward proposal based on the clock metaphor,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503382
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Interacting at a distance: measuring the performance of laser pointers and other devices,"It is difficult to interact with computer displays that are across the room. A popular approach is to use laser pointers tracked by a camera, but interaction techniques using laser pointers tend to be imprecise, error-prone, and slow. Although many previous papers discuss laser pointer interaction techniques, none seem to have performed user studies to help inform the design. This paper reports on two studies of laser pointer interactions that answer some of the questions related to interacting with objects using a laser pointer. The first experiment evaluates various parameters of laser pointers. For example, the time to acquire a target is about 1 second, and the jitter due to hand unsteadiness is about ±8 pixels, which can be reduced to about ±2 to ±4 pixels by filtering. We compared 7 different ways to hold various kinds of laser pointers, and found that a laser pointer built into a PalmOS device was the most stable. The second experiment compared 4 different ways to select objects on a large projected display. We found that tapping directly on a wall-size SmartBoard was the fastest and most accurate method, followed by a new interaction technique that copies the area of interest from the big screen to a handheld. Third in speed was the conventional mouse, and the laser pointer came in last, with a time almost twice as long as tapping on the SmartBoard",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503383
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Messages embedded in gaze of interface agents --- impression management with agent's gaze,"We propose a gaze movement model that enables an embodied interface agent to convey different impressions to users. Managing one's own impression to influence the behaviors of others plays an important role in human communications. To create a new application area which involves agents in this kind of social interaction, interface agents that manage their impressions are required. For this purpose, we build the gaze movement model based on three gaze parameters picked from a large number of psychological studies: <i>amount of gaze</i>, <i>mean duration of gaze</i>, and <i>gaze points while averted</i>. In this paper, we introduce the gaze movement model and gaze parameters. We then present an experiment in which subjects evaluated the impressions created by nine gaze patterns produced by altering the gaze parameters. The results indicate that reproducible relations exist between the gaze parameters and impressions, which shows the validity of the model",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503385
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Leveraging the asymmetric sensitivity of eye contact for videoconference,"Eye contact is a natural and often essential element in the language of visual communication. Unfortunately, perceiving eye contact is difficult in most video-conferencing systems and hence limits their effectiveness. We conducted experiments to determine how accurately people perceive eye contact. We discovered that the sensitivity to eye contact is asymmetric, in that we are an order of magnitude less sensitive to eye contact when people look below our eyes than when they look to the left, right, or above our eyes. Additional experiments support a theory that people are prone to perceive eye contact, that is, we will think that someone is making eye contact with us unless we are certain that the person is not looking into our eyes. These experimental results suggest parameters for the design of videoconferencing systems. As a demonstration, we were able to construct from commodity components a simple dyadic videoconferencing prototype that supports eye contact",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503386
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Acquisition of expanding targets,"There exist several user interface widgets that dynamically grow in size in response to the user's focus of attention. Some of these, such as icons in toolbars, expand to facilitate their selection - allowing for a reduced initial size in an attempt to optimize screen space use. However, selection performance may be degraded by this decreased initial widget size. We describe an experiment which explores the effects of varying parameters of expansion techniques in a selection task. Our results suggest that Fitts' law can model and predict performance in such tasks. They also indicate that performance is governed by the target's <i>final</i> size, not its initial one. Further, performance is dependent on the target's final size even when the target only begins expanding as late as after 90% of the movement towards the target has already been completed. These results indicate that expanding widgets can be used without sacrificing performance",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503388
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Quantitative analysis of scrolling techniques,"We propose a formal experimental paradigm designed to help evaluate scrolling interaction techniques. Such a method is needed by interaction designers to quantify scrolling performance, thereby providing a tool to evaluate and improve upon new techniques. We systematically vary the scrolling <i>distance</i> as well as the required <i>tolerance</i> of scrolling. Distance and tolerance are the parameters of Fitts' Law, which traditionally has been applied to the evaluation of pointing devices in tasks involving rapid, aimed movement to visible targets. Scrolling involves acquisition of targets well beyond the edges of the screen, yet Fitts' Law models our experimental data very wellWe apply our paradigm to the IBM ScrollPoint and the IntelliMouse Wheel. Our experimental approach reveals a crossover effect in performance versus distance, with the Wheel performing best at short distances but the ScrollPoint performing best at long distances. We also demonstrate that the performance of the Wheel can be significantly improved using an acceleration algorithm. These results show that our approach yields a practical and rigorous method for the evaluation of scrolling techniques.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503389
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,More than dotting the i's --- foundations for crossing-based interfaces,"Today's graphical interactive systems largely depend upon pointing actions, i.e. entering an object and selecting it. In this paper we explore whether an alternate paradigm --- crossing boundaries --- may substitute or complement pointing as another fundamental interaction method. We describe an experiment in which we systematically evaluate two target-pointing tasks and four goal-crossing tasks, which differ by the direction of the movement variability constraint (collinear vs. orthogonal) and by the nature of the action (pointing vs. crossing, discrete vs. continuous). We found that participants' temporal performance in each of the six tasks was dependent on the index of difficulty formulated in the same way as in Fitts' law, but that the parameters differ by task. We also found that goal crossing completion time was shorter or no longer than pointing performance under the same index of difficulty. These regularities, as well as qualitative characterizations of crossing actions and their application in HCI, lay the foundation for designing crossing-based user interfaces",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503390
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,A Case Study to Distill Structural Scaffolding Guidelines for Scaffolded Software Environments,"A challenge for HCI researchers and designers involves developing software tools for learners to support them in mindfully doing and learning complex new work practices. Such ""learner-centered"" tools incorporate scaffolds-software features that address the cognitive obstacles learners face so they can engage in the work in an educationally productive manner. However, designers still lack specific scaffolding design guidelines for developing effective scaffolded tools. The HCI contribution of this paper is a set of scaffolding guidelines distilled from an empirical case study. The study evaluated Symphony, a scaffolded environment for high school students learning science inquiry. The study evaluated the ""effects with"" the Symphony scaffolds, which described how students worked with the scaffolds to do their science work. The scaffolds were evaluated using several usability and learner-centered criteria, and the resulting information was correlated with structural characteristics of the scaffolds to distill a set of structural scaffolding guidelines",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503392
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Notification for shared annotation of digital documents,"Notification and shared annotations go hand-in-hand. Notification of activity in a shared document system is known to support awareness and improve asynchronous collaboration, but few studies have examined user needs and explored design tradeoffs. We examined large-scale use of notifications in a commercial system and found it lacking. We designed and deployed enhancements to the system, then conducted a field study to gauge their effect. We found that providing more information in notification messages, supporting multiple communication channels through which notifications can be received, and allowing customization of notification messages are particularly important. Overall awareness of annotation activity on software specifications increased with our enhancements",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503393
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"""I'd be overwhelmed, but it's just one more thing to do"": availability and interruption in research management","Many CSCW projects dealing with individual availability and interruption filtering achieve only limited success. Perhaps this is because designers of such systems have limited evidence to draw upon; most data on interruption management is at least a decade old. This study uses an empirical sampling method and qualitative interviews to examine attitudes toward availability and interruption. Specifically, we analyze how corporate research managers spend their time and look at how their attitudes toward interruption relate to their various activities. Attitudes toward interruption are marked by a complex tension between wanting to avoid interruption and appreciating its usefulness. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for design, suggesting that the notion of socially translucent systems may be a fruitful approach",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503394
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Comparing voodoo dolls and HOMER: exploring the importance of feedback in virtual environments,"When creating techniques for manipulating objects at a distance in immersive virtual environments, researchers have primarily focused on increasing selection range, placement range, and placement accuracy. This focus has led researchers to create and formally study a series of ""arm-extension"" techniques, which dynamically scale the user's arm to allow him to manipulate distant objects. Researchers have also developed representation-based techniques, which allow users to manipulate a distant object by manipulating a copy of it in a handheld representation. However, researchers have not yet formally established the relative value of these techniques. In this paper we present a formal study comparing Voodoo Dolls, a best-practice representation-based technique, with HOMER, a best-practice arm-extension technique. We found that the Voodoo Dolls technique, which provides better feedback by allowing users to view a manipulated object both up close and at a distance, allowed users to both position and orient objects more accurately. Our results suggest that researchers should focus on improving feedback for 3D manipulation techniques",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503396
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,SmartSkin: an infrastructure for freehand manipulation on interactive surfaces,"This paper introduces a new sensor architecture for making interactive surfaces that are sensitive to human hand and finger gestures. This sensor recognizes multiple hand positions and shapes and calculates the distance between the hand and the surface by using capacitive sensing and a mesh-shaped antenna. In contrast to camera-based gesture recognition systems, all sensing elements can be integrated within the surface, and this method does not suffer from lighting and occlusion problems. This paper describes the sensor architecture, as well as two working prototype systems: a table-size system and a tablet-size system. It also describes several interaction techniques that would be difficult to perform without using this architecture",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503397
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Creating principal 3D curves with digital tape drawing,Previous systems have explored the challenges of designing an interface for automotive styling which combine the metaphor of 2D drawing using physical tape with the simultaneous creation and management of a corresponding virtual 3D model. These systems have been limited to only 2D planar curves while typically the principal characteristic curves of an automotive design are three dimensional and non-planar. We present a system which addresses this limitation. Our system allows a designer to construct these non-planar 3D curves by drawing a series of 2D curves using the 2D tape drawing technique and interaction style. These results are generally applicable to the interface design of 3D modeling applications and also to the design of arm's length interaction on large scale display systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503398
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Adaptive testing: effects on user performance,"This study examines the effects of interface adaptation on user performance in HCI and CMC. No studies to date have explored the psychological effects of a combination of software performance monitoring and adaptation. This combination is the focus of the present study. Two competing possible effects of adaptive interfaces are presented: 1) Social facilitation, according to which users with high task confidence should perform better, and users with low task confidence should perform less well because their performance is monitored by the interface; and 2) ""choking"", according to which users with high task confidence should perform less well, and users with low task confidence should perform better because the interface adapts to their performance. A 2 (adaptive vs. non-adaptive) x 2 (high user task confidence vs. low task confidence) x 2 (HCI vs. CMC) laboratory experiment was conducted. Results indicate that for CMC, the social facilitation explanation holds true, while results for HCI were consistent with the ""choking"" explanation. Implications for the theory and design of adaptive interfaces are discussed",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503400
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Effects of four computer-mediated communications channels on trust development,"When virtual teams need to establish trust at a distance, it is advantageous for them to use rich media to communicate. We studied the emergence of trust in a social dilemma game in four different communication situations: face-to-face, video, audio, and text chat. All three of the richer conditions were significant improvements over text chat. Video and audio conferencing groups were nearly as good as face-to-face, but both did show some evidence of what we term <i>delayed trust</i> (slower progress toward full cooperation) and <i>fragile trust</i> (vulnerability to opportunistic behavior)",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503401
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Trust without touch: jumpstarting long-distance trust with initial social activities,"Computer-mediated communication (CMC) is thought to be inadequate when one needs to establish trust. If, however, people meet before using CMC, they trust each other, trust being established through touch. Here we show that if participants do <i>not</i> meet beforehand but rather engage in various getting-acquainted activities over a network, trust is much higher than if they do nothing beforehand, nearly as good as a prior meeting. Using text-chat to get acquainted is nearly as good as meeting, and even just seeing a picture is better than nothing",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503402
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Automating CPM-GOMS,"CPM-GOMS is a modeling method that combines the task decomposition of a GOMS analysis with a model of human resource usage at the level of cognitive, perceptual, and motor operations. CPM-GOMS models have made accurate predictions about skilled user behavior in routine tasks, but developing such models is tedious and error-prone. We describe a process for automatically generating CPM-GOMS models from a hierarchical task decomposition expressed in a cognitive modeling tool called Apex. Resource scheduling in Apex automates the difficult task of interleaving the cognitive, perceptual, and motor resources underlying common task operators (e.g. mouse move-and-click). Apex's UI automatically generates PERT charts, which allow modelers to visualize a model's complex parallel behavior. Because interleaving and visualization is now automated, it is feasible to construct arbitrarily long sequences of behavior. To demonstrate the process, we present a model of automated teller interactions in Apex and discuss implications for user modeling",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503404
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Investigating human-computer optimization,"Scheduling, routing, and layout tasks are examples of hard optimization problems with broad application in industry. Past research in this area has focused on algorithmic issues. However, this approach neglects many important human-computer interaction issues that must be addressed to provide people with practical solutions to optimization problems. Automatic methods do not leverage human expertise and can only find solutions that are optimal with regard to an invariably over-simplified problem description. Furthermore, users must understand the generated solutions in order to implement, justify, or modify them. Interactive optimization helps address these issues but has not previously been studied in detail. This paper describes experiments on an interactive optimization system that explore the most appropriate way to combine the respective strengths of people and computers. Our results show that users can successfully identify promising areas of the search space as well as manage the amount of computational effort expended on different subproblems",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503405
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,An evaluation of a multiple interface design solution for bloated software,"This study examines a novel interface design for heavily-featured productivity software. The design includes two interfaces between which the user can easily toggle: (1) an interface personalized by the user containing desired features only, and (2) the default interface with all the standard features. This design was prototyped as a front-end to a commercial word processor and evaluated in a comprehensive field study. The study tested the effects of different interface designs on users' satisfaction and their perceived ability to navigate, control, and learn the software. There were two conditions: a commercial word processor with adaptive menus and our two-interface prototype with adaptable menus for the same word processor. Results showed that participants were better able to navigate through the menus and toolbars and were better able to learn with our prototype. There were also significant differences in satisfaction and control with our design",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503406
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Introducing instant messaging and chat in the workplace,"We report on our experiences of introducing an instant messaging and group chat application into geographically distributed workgroups. We describe a number of issues we encountered, including privacy concerns, individual versus group training, and focusing on teams or individuals. The perception of the tool's utility was a complex issue, depending both on users' views of the importance of informal communication, and their perceptions of the nature of cross-site communication issues. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of critical mass, which is related to the features each user actually uses. More generally, we encountered a dilemma that imposes serious challenges for user-centered design of groupware systems",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503408
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Hubbub: a sound-enhanced mobile instant messenger that supports awareness and opportunistic interactions,"There have been many attempts to support awareness and lightweight interactions using video and audio, but few have been built on widely available infrastructure. Text-based systems have become more popular, but few support awareness, opportunistic conversations, and mobility, three important elements of distributed collaboration. We built on the popularity of text-based Instant Messengers (IM) by building a mobile IM called Hubbub that tries to provide all three, notably through the use of earcons. In a 5.5-month use study, we found that Hubbub helped people feel connected to colleagues in other locations and supported opportunistic interactions. The sounds provided effective awareness cues, although some found them annoying. It was more important to support graceful transitions between multiple fixed locations than to support wireless access, although both were useful",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503409
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,When conventions collide: the tensions of instant messaging attributed,"We discuss findings from observation, interviews, and textual analysis of instant messaging use in a university research lab setting. We propose a method for characterizing the tensions that permeate instant messaging texts and that expose the collision between conventions of verbal and written communication. Given this method, we suggest a design space for exploring potential design choices in instant messaging clients. Finally, we recommend an analysis of communicative conventions as a fruitful lens through which designers might anticipate or circumvent design tensions in emergent computer-mediated communication technologies",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503410
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Women take a wider view,"Published reports suggest that males significantly outperform females in navigating virtual environments. A novel navigation technique reported in CHI 2001, when combined with a large display and wide field of view, appeared to reduce that gender bias. That work has been extended with two navigation studies in order to understand the finding under carefully controlled conditions. The first study replicated the finding that a wide field of view coupled with a large display benefits both male and female users and reduces gender bias. The second study suggested that wide fields of view on a large display were useful to females despite a more densely populated virtual world. Implications for design of virtual worlds and large displays are discussed. Specifically, women take a wider field of view to achieve similar virtual environment navigation performance to men",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503412
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Evaluating the effectiveness of spatial memory in 2D and 3D physical and virtual environments,"User interfaces can improve task performance by exploiting the powerful human capabilities for spatial cognition. This opportunity has been demonstrated by many prior experiments. It is tempting to believe that providing greater spatial flexibility-by moving from flat 2D to 3D user interfaces-will further enhance user performance. This paper describes an experiment that investigates the effectiveness of spatial memory in real-world physical models and in equivalent computer-based virtual systems. The different models vary the user's freedom to use depth and perspective in spatial arrangements of images representing web pages. Results show that the subjects' performance deteriorated in both the physical and virtual systems as their freedom to locate items in the third dimension increased. Subjective measures reinforce the performance measures, indicating that users found interfaces with higher dimensions more 'cluttered' and less efficient",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503413
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Learning where to look: location learning in graphical user interfaces,"A theoretical account is presented on how locations of interface objects are learned and how the mechanisms underlying location learning interact with the representativeness of object labels. The account is embodied in a computational cognitive model built within the ACT-R/PM cognitive architecture [1, 2] and is supported by point-of-gaze and performance data collected in empirical research. The model interacts with the same software under the same experimental task conditions as study participants and replicates both performance and the finer-grained point-of-gaze data. Drawing from the data and model, location learning is characterized as a process that occurs as a by-product of interaction such that, without specific intent to do so, users can gradually learn the locations of the interface objects to which they attend. Characteristics of the user interface shape this learning process, however, by constraining the set of possible strategies for interaction. Locations are learned more quickly when the least-effortful strategy available in the interface explicitly requires retrieval of location knowledge",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503414

We compare this interface with two other interfaces that are in common use today and found that subjective satisfaction was statistically better with the new interface. Performance metrics however, like time to task completion and number of clicks were worse.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503416

By examining in detail a complete two-day set of Web activities from each of 24 people, we construct a framework with which to describe the different tasks knowledge workers undertake. By looking at the characteristics of each type of activity, we can see how certain activities are unsuited to particular kinds of technologies (e.g., mobile devices); how Web tools might be incrementally improved; and how we might better support knowledge workers' Web tasks in the future",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503418

CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Separating the swarm: categorization methods for user sessions on the web,"Understanding user behaviors on Web sites enables site owners to make sites more usable, ultimately helping users to achieve their goals more quickly. Accordingly, researchers have devised methods for categorizing user sessions in hopes of revealing user interests. These techniques build user profiles by combining users' navigation paths with other data features, such as page viewing time, hyperlink structure, and page content. Previously, we have presented complex techniques of combining many of these data features to cluster user profiles. In this paper, we introduce a user study and a systematic evaluation of these different data features and their associated weighting schemes. We present the results of our study, including accuracy measures for a number of clustering approaches, and offer recommendations for Web analysts. While further investigation over more sites is needed to definitively settle on a robust scheme, we have characterized this analytic space",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503420
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Popout prism: adding perceptual principles to overview+detail document interfaces,"We present an overview+detail document interface that draws on perceptual principles to help users work with documents. Central to our approach is the use of improved document overviews. Our approach also includes novel highlighting in the full representation of documents, as well as techniques to help users smoothly transition from the overview to the full representation of the document. We present a specific implementation of our design for Web browsing. We also present a qualitative user study that indicates that our perceptual design principles are effective and that users prefer our interface to traditional ""find"" and highlighting techniques. Our user study additionally reveals interesting tasks and strategies supported in our framework that have implications for overview+detail document interfaces in general",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503422
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"Keeping things in context: a comparative evaluation of focus plus context screens, overviews, and zooming","Users working with documents that are too large and detailed to fit on the user's screen (e.g. chip designs) have the choice between zooming or applying appropriate visualization techniques. In this paper, we present a comparison of three such techniques. The first, focus plus context screens, are wall-size low-resolution displays with an embedded high-resolution display region. This technique is compared with overview plus detail and zooming/panning. We interviewed fourteen visual surveillance and design professionals from different areas (graphic design, chip design, air traffic control, etc.) in order to create a repre sentative sample of tasks to be used in two experimental comparison studies. In the first experiment, subjects using focus plus context screens to extract information from large static documents completed the two experimental tasks on average 21% and 36% faster than when they used the other interfaces. In the second experiment, focus plus context screens allowed subjects to reduce their error rate in a driving simulation to less than one third of the error rate of the competing overview plus detail setup",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503423
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Improving focus targeting in interactive fisheye views,"Fisheye views allow people to see both a focus region and the surrounding context in the same window. However, the magnification effects of the fisheye lens can cause several problems for users. One of these is focus-targeting, where a user moves the focus to a new location. Magnification makes focus-targeting difficult because objects appear to move as the focus point approaches them. This paper examines how the distortion of a fisheye view affects focus-targeting performance, and present a technique called speed-coupled flattening (SCF) as a way to improve focus targeting in distortion-oriented views. SCF dynamically reduces the distortion level of a fisheye based on pointer velocity and acceleration. In an experiment, the technique resulted in significant reductions in both targeting time and targeting errors. By adjusting distortion based on the user's activity, we can improve usability without requiring the user to manipulate any additional view controls",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503424
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"SCANMail: a voicemail interface that makes speech browsable, readable and searchable","Increasing amounts of public, corporate, and private speech data are now available on-line. These are limited in their usefulness, however, by the lack of tools to permit their browsing and search. The goal of our research is to provide tools to overcome the inherent difficulties of speech access, by supporting visual scanning, search, and information extraction. We describe a novel principle for the design of UIs to speech data: <i>What You See Is Almost What You Hear (WYSIAWYH)</i>. In <i>WYSIAWYH</i>, automatic speech recognition (ASR) generates a transcript of the speech data. The transcript is then used as a <i>visual analogue</i> to that underlying data. A graphical user interface allows users to visually scan, read, annotate and search these transcripts. Users can also use the transcript to access and play specific regions of the underlying message. We first summarize previous studies of voicemail usage that motivated the <i>WYSIAWYH</i> principle, and describe a voicemail UI, SCANMail, that embodies <i>WYSIAWYH</i>. We report on a laboratory experiment and a two-month field trial evaluation. SCANMail outperformed a state of the art voicemail system on core voicemail tasks. This was attributable to SCANMail's support for visual scanning, search and information extraction. While the ASR transcripts contain errors, they nevertheless improve the efficiency of voicemail processing. Transcripts either provide enough information for users to extract key points or to navigate to important regions of the underlying speech, which they can then play directly",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503426
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,A comparative study of speech in the call center: natural language call routing vs. touch-tone menus,"This paper presents a field study that compares natural language call routing with standard touch-tone menus. <i>Call routing</i> is the task of getting callers to the right place in the call center, which could be the appropriate live agent or automated service. <i>Natural language</i> call routing lets callers describe the reason for their call in their own words, instead of presenting them with a list of menu options to select from using the telephone touch-tone keypad. The field study was conducted in a call center of a large telecommunication service provider. Results show that with natural language call routing, more callers respond to the main routing prompt, more callers are routed to a specific destination (instead of defaulting to a general operator who may have to transfer them), and more callers are routed to the <i>correct</i> agent. Our survey data show that callers overwhelmingly prefer natural language call routing over standard touch-tone menus. Furthermore, natural language call routing can also deliver significant cost savings to call centers",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503427
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Gestural and audio metaphors as a means of control for mobile devices,This paper discusses the use of gesture and non-speech audio as ways to improve the user interface of a mobile music player. Their key advantages mean that users could use a player without having to look at its controls when on the move. Two very different evaluations of the player took place: one based on a standard usability experiment (comparing the new player to a standard design) and the other a video analysis of the player in use. Both of these showed significant usability improvements for the gesture/audio-based interface over a standard visual/pen-based display. The similarities and differences in the results produced by the two studies are discussed,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503428
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Physical programming: designing tools for children to create physical interactive environments,"Physical interactive environments can come in many forms: museum installations, amusement parks, experimental theaters, and more. Programming these environments has historically been done by adults, and children, as the visiting participants, have been offered few pre-created choices to explore. Given these creative limitations, the goal of our research has been to develop programming tools for physical interactive environments that are appropriate for use by young children (ages 4-6). We have explored numerous design approaches over the past two years. Recently we began focusing on a ""physical programming"" approach and developed a wizard-of-oz prototype for young children. This paper presents the motivation for this research, the evolution of our programming approach, and our recent explorations with children",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503430
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,A visual language for sketching large and complex interactive designs,"Informal, sketch-based design tools closely match the work practices of user interface designers. Current tools, however, are limited in the size and complexity of interaction that can be specified. We have created an advanced sketch-based visual language that allows for easy prototyping of large, complex interactive designs. In its current embodiment in the denim web design tool, the visual language allows designers to sketch reusable components for recurring page elements, such as navigation bars, as well as conditionals to illustrate and test transitions that depend on a user's input. Designers can also specify sites that accept richer user input than simple clicking. Our informal evaluation shows that these features allow designers with little programming experience to quickly create prototypes of large, complex web sites while still working inside an informal, sketch-based environment",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503431
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Specifying preferences based on user history,"Many applications require users to specify preferences. We support users in this task by letting them define preferences relative to their personal history or that of other users. We implement this idea using a graphical technique called control shadows, which we have implemented on both a desktop computer and on a cell phone with a small, grayscale display. An empirical study compared user performance on the graphical interface and a text table interface with identical functionality. On the desktop, users completed their tasks more quickly and effectively and strongly preferred the graphical interface. On the cell phone, there was no significant difference between the graphical and table interfaces. Finally, personal history proved useful in specifying preferences, but history of other users was not helpful",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503433
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Observed behavior and perceived value of authors in usenet newsgroups: bridging the gap,"In this paper we describe an evaluation of behavioral descriptors generated from an analysis of a large collection of Usenet newsgroup messages. The metrics describe aspects of newsgroup authors' behavior over time; such information can aid in filtering, sorting, and recommending content from public discussion spaces like newsgroups. To assess the value of a variety of these behavioral descriptors, we compared 22 participants' subjective evaluations of authors whose messages they read to behavioral metrics describing the same authors. We found that many metrics, particularly the longevity and frequency of participation, the number of newsgroups to which authors contribute messages, and the amount they contribute to each thread, correlate highly with readers' subjective evaluations of the authors",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503434
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Diffusing information in organizational settings: learning from experience,"Recommender systems selectively circulate information enriched with comments and feedback based on people's experience. These systems filter information in a semi-automatic and high-quality way in order to support a community during their work or leisure practices. However recommender systems are usually separate tools that require a degree of effort to be used, both when receiving information and to insert new feedback. In this paper we present our informal experiences with the use of multiple user interfaces (interactive large screen, email, paper and PDA) as means to improve the diffusion of information through an organizational unit and to improve access to information stored within an existing recommender system",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503435
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,A tangible interface for organizing information using a grid,"The task of organizing information is typically performed either by physically manipulating note cards or sticky notes or by arranging icons on a computer with a graphical user interface. We present a new tangible interface platform for manipulating discrete pieces of abstract information, which attempts to combine the benefits of each of these two alternatives into a single system. We developed interaction techniques and an example application for organizing conference papers. We assessed the effectiveness of our system by experimentally comparing it to both graphical and paper interfaces. The results suggest that our tangible interface can provide a more effective means of organizing, grouping, and manipulating data than either physical operations or graphical computer interaction alone",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503437
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Cognitive cubes: a tangible user interface for cognitive assessment,"Assessments of spatial, constructional ability are used widely in cognitive research and in clinical diagnosis of disease or injury. Some believe that three-dimensional (3D) forms of these assessments would be particularly sensitive, but difficulties with consistency in administration and scoring have limited their use. We describe Cognitive Cubes, a novel computerized tool for 3D constructional assessment that increases consistency and promises improvements in flexibility, reliability, sensitivity and control. Cognitive Cubes makes use of ActiveCube, a novel tangible user interface for describing 3D shape. In testing, Cognitive Cubes was sensitive to differences in cognitive ability and task, and correlated well to a standard paper-and-pencil 3D spatial assessment",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503438
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Illuminating clay: a 3-D tangible interface for landscape analysis,This paper describes a novel system for the real-time computational analysis of landscape models. Users of the system - called Illuminating Clay - alter the topography of a clay landscape model while the changing geometry is captured in real-time by a ceiling-mounted laser scanner. A depth image of the model serves as an input to a library of landscape analysis functions. The results of this analysis are projected back into the workspace and registered with the surfaces of the model.We describe a scenario for which this kind of tool has been developed and we review past work that has taken a similar approach. We describe our system architecture and highlight specific technical issues in its implementation.We conclude with a discussion of the benefits of the system in combining the tangible immediacy of physical models with the dynamic capabilities of computational simulations.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503439

This study investigates recall and recognition of animated banner advertisements in an attempt to identify design guidelines. It was hypothesized that animation would increase recall and recognition of novel ads by increasing user awareness. No significant relationships were found between the use of animation and ability to recall and recognize banner ads.

CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Statistical profiles of highly-rated web sites,"We are creating an interactive tool to help non-professional web site builders create high quality designs. We have previously reported that quantitative measures of web page structure can predict whether a site will be highly or poorly rated by experts, with accuracies ranging from 67--80%. In this paper we extend that work in several ways. First, we compute a much larger set of measures (157 versus 11), over a much larger collection of pages (5300 vs. 1900), achieving much higher overall accuracy (94% on average) when contrasting good, average, and poor pages. Second, we introduce new classes of measures that can make assessments at the site level and according to page type (home page, content page, etc.). Finally, we create statistical profiles of good sites, and apply them to an existing design, showing how that design can be changed to better match high-quality designs",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503442

In a controlled clinical study, we deployed HutchWorld to bone marrow transplant patients and their caregivers and assessed the impact of Internet access and HutchWorld on their quality of life. We found that Internet access and the use of HutchWorld helped to buffer study participants against reductions in life satisfaction and social support following the transplant procedure.

We describe a participatory analysis of the diversity of working relations and roles of designers of IBM's Lotus software products. Designers are an example of a <i>minority discipline</i> - that is, a discipline whose members are often isolated in their work teams among coworkers with different training, backgrounds, and career paths. We explore differences between the practices of designers of Lotus software products and the published reports of design practices in group settings",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503445
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"Designing for improved social responsibility, user participation and content in on-line communities","Web sites face difficult challenges in supporting successful communities. In this paper we discuss 2 operating web sites, identically designed but with different and distinct audiences. These sites collect user data from site activity and feed it back to the user community in novel ways. The sites are highly active and growing, and have fostered socially conscious, easily navigable and comprehensible on-line communities with little cost and maintenance. The practice of user data collection and re-purposing we describe works particularly well in highly contextual or information /resource-driven communities. These sites also integrate custom content authoring tools and track their use. The authoring tools were designed to quickly grow a specialized ""knowledge base"" of content created by users and published to a larger audience. A status system encourages the participation of users to contribute to this knowledge base, while increasing social awareness and responsibility in areas of high user interaction. All user activity, communications, and feedback are tracked. Then data is compiled and re-incorporated into scalable solutions for better navigability, content filtering, and presentation of contents to a larger audience. This practice creates a uniquely high quality of interaction within web communities",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503446

We draw on field studies of domestic life as this domain is becoming increasingly important for new technologies and challenges many of the assumptions we take for granted in the design of technologies for the workplace. We use some examples of domestic routines to identify a number of insights into what it means for features of activities to be ""unremarkable"". We conclude by using these insights to critique some of the current emphases in Ubiquitous Computing research, and suggest how we might better understand the HCI issues of what will be required to develop technologies that really are ""invisible in use""",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503448
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,"Comparing paper and tangible, multimodal tools","In command posts, officers maintain situational awareness using paper maps, Post-it notes, and hand-written annotations. They do so because paper is robust to failure, it is portable, it offers a flexible means of capturing information, it has ultra-high resolution, and it readily supports face-to-face collaboration. We report herein on an evaluation comparing maps and Post-its with a tangible multimodal system called Rasa. Rasa augments these paper tools with sensors, enabling it to recognize the multimodal language (both written and spoken) that naturally occurs on them. In this study, we found that not only do users prefer Rasa to paper alone, they find it as easy or easier to use than paper tools. Moreover, Rasa introduces no discernible overhead in its operation other than error repair, yet grants the benefits inherent in digital systems. Finally, subjects confirmed that by combining physical and computational tools, Rasa is resistant to computational failure",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503449

Specifically, we present five design challenges inspired by analysis of human-human communication that are mundanely addressed by traditional graphical user interface designs (GUIs). Although classic GUI conventions allow us to finesse these questions, recent research into innovative interaction techniques such as 'Ubiquitous Computing' and 'Tangible Interfaces' has begun to expose the interaction challenges and problems they pose. By making them explicit we open a discourse on how an approach similar to that used by social scientists in studying human-human interaction might inform the design of novel interaction mechanisms that can be used to handle human-computer communication accomplishments",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503450

However, many systems impede visitor interaction. By contrast, our electronic guidebook, <i>Sotto Voce</i>, has social interaction as a primary design goal. The system enables visitors to share audio information - specifically, they can hear each other's guidebook activity using a technologically mediated audio eavesdropping mechanism. We conducted a study of visitors using <i>Sotto Voce</i> while touring a historic house. The results indicate that visitors are able to use the system effectively, both as a conversational resource and as an information appliance. More surprisingly, our results suggest that the technologically mediated audio often cohered the visitors' conversation and activity to a far greater degree than audio delivered through the open air",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503454

Through the data, we suggest that teenagers use their phones to participate in social practices that closely resemble forms of ritualised gift-giving. Such practices, we claim, shape the way teenagers understand and thus use their phones. We go onto show that this insight into everyday, phone-mediated activities has practical implications for mobile phone design. Using an example, we describe how teenagers' gift-giving practices can inform design, providing an initial means to conceptualise future emerging technologies",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503455

CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Groupware walkthrough: adding context to groupware usability evaluation,"Discount usability evaluation methods have recently been introduced as a way to assess groupware systems. However, one criticism of these techniques is that they do not make use of information about users and their work contexts. To address this problem, we developed groupware walkthrough, a new usability inspection technique for groupware. The technique is a substantive modification of cognitive walkthrough to include consideration for the complexities of teamwork. The two components of groupware walkthrough are a task model for identifying and analysing real-world collaborative tasks, and a walkthrough process for assessing a system's support for those tasks. Groupware walkthrough is a low-cost technique that can identify collaboration-specific usability problems and can find problems that would not be revealed through other inspection methods",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503458
CHI '02: Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,Cognitive walkthrough for the web,"This paper proposes a transformation of the Cognitive Walkthrough (CW), a theory-based usability inspection method that has proven useful in designing applications that support use by exploration. The new Cognitive Walkthrough for the Web (CWW) is superior for evaluating how well websites support users' navigation and information search tasks. The CWW uses Latent Semantic Analysis to objectively estimate the degree of semantic similarity (information scent) between representative user goal statements (100-200 words) and heading/link texts on each web page. Using an actual website, the paper shows how the CWW identifies three types of problems in web page designs. Three experiments test CWW predictions of users' success rates in accomplishing goals, verifying the value of CWW for identifying these usability problems",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503459

The paper identifies the most widely used methods and processes, the key factors that predict success, and the critical tradeoffs practitioners must make in applying UCD methods and processes. Results show that cost-benefit tradeoffs are a key consideration in the adoption of UCD methods. Measures of UCD effectiveness are lacking and rarely applied. There is also a major discrepancy between the commonly cited measures and the actually applied ones. These results have implications for the introduction, deployment, and execution of UCD projects",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/503376.503460
CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems. (Part - II): Human Interface and the User Interface - Volume 1981,Recent advances in user assistance,"As interactive users find conventional methods of training and documentation inadequate, designers are providing systems with online reference information, descriptions of valid input, elaboration of error messages, and explanations of a system's behavior. This paper describes some existing commercial systems that offer online assistance and more experimental approaches by the research community. The following material was originally presented at the SIGSOC conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computing Systems. An extended version will appear in a special issue of the IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Volume SMC-12, March/April, 1982), and is reprinted here with the permission of the IEEE.Online user assistance is now offered on commercial systems and is the subject of investigation in experimental settings. It is difficult to compare the advantages and limitations of different approaches because they vary along many dimensions and because there is no commonly accepted terminology. A grouping of these dimensions into major categories is a necessary first step towards more empirical evaluations. The major software-related features of online assistance appear to fall into four categories:&amp;bull; access method -- the way users can construct or enter requests for assistance;&amp;bull; data structure -- the manner in which different portions of assistance information are related to each other;&amp;bull; software architecture -- how assistance requests and their responses are communicated among a user, an operating system, application programs, and the assistance database; and&amp;bull; contextual knowledge -- how much information is retained about the assistance environment, including the user, the application, and the tasks being performed.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800276.810953

(Part - II): Human Interface and the User Interface - Volume 1981,Automatic construction of explanation networks for a cooperative user interface,"This paper is concerned with providing <i>automatically generated</i> on-line explanations to the user of a functional computer subsystem or <i>tool</i> about what the tool can and cannot do, what parameters and options are available or required with a given command, etc.. The explanations are given through the COUSIN interface system which provides a cooperative tool-independent user interface for tools whose objects, operations, input syntax, display formats, etc. are declaratively represented in a <i>tool description</i> data base. The explanations are produced automatically from this data base, with no incremental effort on the part of the tool designer, and in a single uniform style for any tool that uses COUSIN as its interface. The explanation facility takes the form of a fine-grained, tightly linked network of text frames supported by the ZOG menu-selection system. Exactly what information the net building program, NB, extracts from a tool description, and the way in which this information is formatted in the text frames is controlled by a second declarative data base called the <i>aspect description</i>. The declarative nature of the aspect description makes it easy to adapt NB to changes in and extensions to the tool description formalism, and to experiment with the structure of the explanation network. We also describe how the appropriate network frame can be found and displayed in response to specific explanation requests from the user.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800276.810954
CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems. (Part - II): Human Interface and the User Interface - Volume 1981,Using offline documentation online,"Current interactive programs usually provide some form of online documentation in addition to the traditional hard-copy user's manual. To save the expense of writing two documents covering the same material, it is not uncommon to find offline manuals that are available interactively as well as printed versions of material originally organized for online use. Because of the difficulties inherent in using the same material in different ways, neither approach is totally satisfactory. The THUMB system minimizes these problems by structuring offline documentation for interactive use. An expert on a particular text (<i>e.g.</i>, its author) prepares a detailed representation of the organization of material within the document. Once this data structure (which resembles a thorough table of contents and heavily cross-referenced index) is available, users access information free from the strictures of linear text, simple indices, and page numbers. The expert's task is nontrivial, but it requires less effort than writing a new document. Creation and revision of text are made easy by supportive utilities. THUMB monitors reader's requests in order to provide experts with feedback about a document's use. Readers need not be aware of THUMB's underlying data structure or the tools available for experts.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800276.810955

The Deep Space Network at Jet Propulsion Laboratory is such a system. In Australia, Spain, and California, operators of the system use inflexible, incompatible routines to route data to Pasadena. Worker motivation and accuracy have to remain high for the system to work. In an attempt to develop redesign guidelines, users were queried regarding their attitudes and difficulties with the system.

Computing in the Eighties will cause every university and college to evaluate and reconsider its exploitation of modern computing equipment for education and research.For example, at Northwestern University, it was recognized that continued growth in timesharing would be a major factor in computing at NU in the 1980s and that this growth would come from a large community of new users and of casual users. In January 1980, the Computing Center began a long-range planning study. A five-year equipment enhancement and replacement plan was to be developed which was intended to reverse an unsatisfactory trend toward computer saturation, to further improve and modernize our computer offerings, and to ensure that NU remained on a path of excellence in computing. Since time-sharing had already increased to over 50% of the total usage of the computer, a decision was made to begin the evaluation of modern timesharing systems, with special emphasis in two areas: 1) efficiency and reliability, and 2) the user interface.This paper describes the processes which were developed and used for the evaluation of the user interface, or as it came to be known, the ""friendliness"" study [1].",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800276.810958

The current computer science literature is replete with papers on the theoretical and practical aspects of the Relational Model and its implementation, as are most recent texts on data management systems.Implicit in the design of the user languages of most database systems, including those based on the Relational Model, are assumptions regarding the patterns of access to and the usage of the content of the database. Somewhat oversimplified, the assumed pattern of access is to search for a particular occurrence (case, observation) in the database which satisfies a given condition, and then to display the values of all attributes (fields, variables) of that one occurrence. The languages are designed to permit users to pose queries such as, for example, ""what widgets do we buy from ABC industries?"" or ""display Jones' employment history"". Queries of this type are termed informational queries; and systems supporting such queries with appropriate user languages and internal data storage techniques and access methods are information systems.A statistical query, similarly oversimplified, specifies a pattern of access to most, if not all, of the occurrences in a database, and a usage pattern of at most a few of the attributes. Examples of statistical queries are ""what is the average size of our purchase orders?"" and ""display the number of employees by race, sex, and job category"". Current statistical systems have limited capability for performing analysis over large and complex data collections, and their user languages reflects this limitation. A statistical query, as defined here, need not involve sophisticated mathematical analysis; the distinction between informational and statistical is derived from the antithetical patterns of access to and usage of the data content of a database. Most work on access languages for relationally based data systems has been on information query languages; very little work has been done on statistical query languages.This paper, then, discusses some elements of a language for statistical queries for a data system employing the Relational Model as the user view of large stored data bases.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800276.810961

Information theory based experiments suggest measures for alternative arrangements. Character sets used in different tasks can be expected to yield different optimal key locations. New tasks are introducing new characters and changing the frequency of selected old ones. Numerous alternative arrangements for alphanumeric fingered entry have been designed, but none are supported by conclusive testing. The amateur keyboard user far outnumbers the professional. Computer entry and word-processors are overtaking the simple typewriter as common alphanumeric stroke entry devices. Compromise and selection of a simplified keyboard that is compatible with present mechanical and electronic designs is advocated.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800276.810962
CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems. (Part - II): Human Interface and the User Interface - Volume 1981,"Adaptable user interfaces for portable, interactive computing software systems","In the context of this paper a computing software system consists of a database, an associated user interface which allows users to analyse the data and the routines or programs which implement the analytic functions available through the user interface. It is assumed that the complete system - source code and data - already exists in a form which is as easily portable as possible between different computer environments. For such systems adaptability is the problem of adjusting the user interface and analytic capabilities to suit different user communities when such a system is transferred from one environment to another. This may include adaptation to specific hardware facilities as well as user requirements.In 1977/8 the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) funded a project at University College Cardiff to implement a portable computing software system originating from the Population Dynamics Group (PDG) at the University of Illinois. This system allowed users to perform population projections under different demographic conditions showing in a graphical presentation how the population of a country varies over selected time spans. The database consisted of population statistics for a number of countries. When implemented at Cardiff it was intended that this system should be used as a demographic training aid by the post graduate diploma students in the David Owen Centre for Population Growth Studies. These students are an international group who are specialists in the field of demography but have little or no computing background.This paper will discuss briefly how this portable system was implemented on a PDP 11 minicomputer at Cardiff and then give a fuller description of the adaptation of the user interface and analytic capabilities to the local community and its computer facilities. General conclusions will be drawn as to how such systems should be written so as to ease the problems of adaptability.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800276.810963

CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems. (Part - II): Human Interface and the User Interface - Volume 1981,Lexicon design using perfect hash functions,"The research reported in this paper derives from the recent algorithm of Cichelli (1980) for computing machine-independent, minimal perfect hash functions of the form:hash value: hash key length + associated value of the key's first letter + associated value of the key's last letterA minimal perfect hash function is one which provides single probe retrieval from a minimally-sized table of hash identifiers [ keys]. Cichelli's hash function is machine-independent because the character code used by a particular machine never enters into the hash calculation.Cichelli's algorithm uses a simple backtracking process to find an assignment of non-negative integers to letters which results in a perfect minimal hash function. Cichelli employs a twofold ordering strategy which rearranges the static set of keys in such a way that hash value collisions will occur and be resolved as early as possible during the backtracking process. This double ordering provides a necessary reduction in the size of the potentially large search space, thus considerably speeding the computation of associated values.In spite of Cichelli's ordering strategies, his method is found to require excessive computation to find hash functions for sets of keys with more than about 40 members. Cichelli's method is also limited since two keys with the same first and last letters and the same length are not permitted.Alternative algorithms and their implementations will be discussed in the next section; these algorithms overcome some of the difficulties encountered when using Cichelli's original algorithm. Some experimental results are presented, followed by a discussion of the application of perfect hash functions to the problem of natural language lexicon design.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800276.810965

These questions were designed to require successively more complex interactions. The database contained Hewlett-Packard's Condensed Order Records, which were pertinent to the jobs of the sales engineers.All of the subjects were given a battery of cognitive tests measuring cognitive style and pattern extrapolation skills prior to using the database. They also received a brief training session on the structure of the database.Analysis of the subjects interactions with the REL ENGLISH database, particularly analysis of the errors made, showed: first, that cognitive style is significantly correlated with the number of questions successfully completed; second, that while sales engineers were able to access all levels of the hierarchy in the database, programmer analysts had significantly more difficulty accessing data from higher levels than they did with data from the same or lower levels than the standard, entry level; and third, that programmer analysts had less difficulty with the fixed-format, programming-language-like features of REL ENGLISH, while sales engineers has less difficulty with the free-format, English-like features of REL ENGLISH.These findings suggest that quasi-natural language database interfaces are appropriate for nonprogrammers who have a field-independent cognitive style and who already are domain experts in the area covered by the database.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800276.810968

My colleagues and I are responsible for a large analysis system [1, 3] that has been in active use outside its development group for about five years and which has several philosophically similar predecessor systems that go back another three or four years [4, 5, 6]. It is interactive in the sense that one of its reasons for existence is to permit the user to interact with data and tease results out of them in a variety of ways -- it has never been, nor is it derived from, a front-end to a batch system or batch thinking. Its users have ranged in skill and background from the beginning student to the professional statistician developing new techniques; from the academic researcher to the clerk in commercial environments. We draw, from this experience, some differing views on what kinds of system designs are friendly and what sorts of assumptions lead to ""friendly"" systems.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800276.810970

CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems. (Part - II): Human Interface and the User Interface - Volume 1981,Interfacing to text using HELPME,"HELPME is a Lisp based system designed to provide on-line help for novice and expert users of computer systems. HELPME permits the implementation of easy to use interfaces to existing documents by allowing a user familiar with a document (a 'document expert') to produce an index and incorporate information relating to the structure of the document into the interface. A typical user of HELPME can then interact with the document and index through a series of commands to quickly find the information desired.The primary advantage of a system like HELPME is that it permits construction of interfaces to existing on-line documents and provides three modes of interaction with the documents: simple display, indexed-based query and context overview. Simple display permits forward and reverse movement through a document while index-based query uses key-words to select relevant sections of the document hierarchy for display. Context overview permits a hierarchical view of the document. For example, the table of contents of a document can be used to construct this hierarchy. Each of these modes of interaction are independent and may be selected by the user at any point. The goal of HELPME is to allow a user to find any information in a document relating to the user's requests. Of course, many users do not have a good grasp on exactly what they are looking for but rely on inadvertent discovery. It is hoped that the flexibility of a HELPME-like system will satisfy the goals of an easy-to-use, extensible help system for computing environments. A long term goal for HELPME is to use domain knowledge and user models in user assistance and information management.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800276.810973

(Part - II): Human Interface and the User Interface - Volume 1981,Living taxonomies in the corporate world: The need for multinested data models,"The complexity of information processing, disseminating and controlling is very high within a sizable corporation. Database design, targeted to carry out these functions, is constantly improving. Nevertheless, nonprogrammers have trouble accessing most databases. Layers of EDP personnel, as well as unresponsive and cumbersome systems, are an obstacle to effective database use.In this paper, we describe an exploratory investigation of databases based on REL ENGLISH [1]. In our system, data structures and access language were designed to map closely the corporate structure and its terminology. Our test vehicle was a portion of Hewlett-Packard's internal information network, the corporate Order Processing System. We have identified about a dozen job related perspectives belonging to geographically dispersed and functionally stratified end-users within various entities of the HP organization. A multinested data model is an intertwined hierarchy: the join of separate hierarchies with different lexicons but shared data events. For our test, we have selected two major intersecting multinested user views: sales and manufacturing. Our design accommodates users with differing perspectives of this model.The system data structures were constructed using the REL ENGLISH primitives. The Condensed Order Records (COR) base spanned a multinested hierarchy four levels deep for the Sales Organization taxonomy and five levels deep for the Manufactured Products taxomony. The design permits the user to query the COR base about the data model itself. He can, of course, also obtain the standard statistical views of the data.Corporate taxonomies are dynamically changing structures. The database model needs to reflect this change. In most cases, the user wants to manipulate data at three levels in his own job taxonomy and at all levels in the other taxonomies. The multinested data model is needed in order to permit the user to view the data from the same perspective that he views his job in the corporate organization.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800276.810975

This report presents early results of a study conducted to ascertain the written analogues of the programming structures iteration, conditional and variables. The study required users already familiar with office procedures to practice a routine forms fill-in and data verification task over a period of one week. At the end of that time, they were required to write a set of procedures as if they were instructing a new person in the performance of the job. These written protocols (in conjunction with verbal protocols taken during the learning phase) were analyzed in terms of the above-mentioned structures.It was found that a variety of structures are used by naive users, but more importantly, all users made serious errors of both omission and commission. In particular, events of low probability were not described at all. In certain cases the written instructions did not correspond with the way in which users actually performed the tasks.The implications for office systems designers, amongst others, are explored.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800276.810976

CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems. (Part - II): Human Interface and the User Interface - Volume 1981,The coming world of “what you see is what you get” (abstract only),"The term 'what you see is what you get' has been used to refer to the editing of fully formatted documents so that every edit change causes the text to be updated immediately to show the document as it would appear when printed, thus eliminating the immediate step of (periodically) invoking a formatter explicitly. This mode of working is generally agreed to result in more and better results with less effort, both because the real-world simulation of a document is easier to use than a mixture of format command statements and unformatted text, and because many errors show up more immediately in a real-world situation than in a complicated abstraction.What happens if we extend this notion throughout the interface between the user and the computer? We enter a world of constrained objects and functional (applicative) actions. If the constraints are algebraic, the result is VISICALC-Iike. If the constraints are formats, the result is format programs which are also (unfilled) documents and can be created and edited as document images. If the constraints are actions themselves, the result is islands of action-programs in a sea of constraints.We propose, as the user interface, a general constraints language for documents. The documents are also ""templates"" or ""forms"", and have a robustness that makes them hard to injure. Anything may be represented as a document, from a memo to a database to a protein molecule. The commands for applying constraints all take no arguments other than the thing the user is pointing at when the command is given. The user's world is then like a large Tinkertoy environment, for constructing active and passive things.Examples of working in this world, in black and white and in color, will be given covering traditional text operations, the construction and use of document templates, the equivalent of programming as we know it, the equivalent of programming as we don't know it, and finally a John Milton template to test the relation between Paradise Lost and the fundamental theorem of the calculus.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800276.810978

CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems. (Part - II): Human Interface and the User Interface - Volume 1981,Design issues for online documentation systems (abstract only),The design of an effective interactive documentation system is introduced by tracing a hypothetical development effort aimed at shifting information contained in printed volumes of documentation to a form suitable for interactive access. Taking this approach presents a view of online documentation systems as the result of the process of adapting information conveyed in printed volumes to the constraint of interactive software considered as an information medium. The resulting discussion necessarily involves consideration of the demands which interactive software makes on both the organization of information about interactive programs and on the cognitive capacities of people using it.Existing documentation is typically intended to serve all of the informational needs of any person who uses an interactive software system. The requirements of software systems for structure and precision demand a more detailed understanding than currently exists of exactly how to provide information to people of varying levels of experience with a particular program or with computing in general. The interaction between the purposes of existing documentation and the requirements of an online system provide an interesting context for discussion of the major issues facing the designer of an interactive documentation system.,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800276.810980

(Part - II): Human Interface and the User Interface - Volume 1981,Naive user behavior in a restricted interactive command environment (abstract only),"Results are reported showing the changing pattern of command use by introductory business data processing students. Using the ability of the University of Calgary's Honeywell Multics Operating System to tailor a command and response environment, a subset of commands and responses (called GENIE) was set up in a user-friendly environment to facilitate novice students programming at CRT terminals. Frequency and time of usage of all commands was metered and changing patterns of usage emerged as the semester progressed. For example, ""help"" usage -- which was originally quite extensive and broad -- limited itself over time to questions only about specific topics. Reluctance to use an ""audit"" facility to capture an interactive session disappeared as the commands for such usage were likened to a movie camera taking pictures over a student's shoulder. It is further noted that specific emphasis was placed on simplifying commands and reducing options.The whole idea of a restricted command environment is compared to the ""abstract machine"" concept of Hopper, Kugler, and Unger who are building a universal command and response language (NICOLA, a NIce Standard COmmand LAnguage). GENIE is seen as an example of what such an abstract machine could be if the Multics operating system were viewed as a basic or ""parent"" abstract machine.

Engineers and scientists are not typically computer professionals; they intimately understand the application at hand and do not want to he bogged down either with computerese and 25 manuals which might contain a desired answer, or with explaining enough of the problem to a computer professional to have the program written by someone else. Ideally, the problem solution should come from the engineer or scientist when viewed from an efficiency perspective. In such application areas, price/performance is no longer the primary factor in selecting computing equipment; ease of adaptability and availability/accessibility are becoming more important criteria when identifying a computer which can provide effective man/machine synergy.The HP 9845 Computing System has the HP IMAGE DBM System capability available as a tool for its users. To help non-computer people to design data bases (the most difficult and frightening part of using data base), we have created a data base design kit manual. This manual will guide a user, through either an intuitive or a rigorous design technique, from problem definition to a working data base diagram. From this diagram, the user is ready to define, create, and use the data base. For this, we have developed a general purpose data base management program, called QUERY/45. QUERY/45 can define and create data bases, and also provides updating facilities including adding, modifying, and deleting information with or without user-defined forms. All of the helps and teaching tools will enable engineers and scientists to use a data base without having to write any programs.

(Part - I): Information Processing in the Social Sciences and Humanities - Volume 1981,"The automation of data processing, analysis, and reporting in a large survey time-series database.","The May 1981 Survey will mark the 152nd Survey of Consumer Attitudes. Initiated in 1946, the purpose of the surveys is to measure changes in consumer attitudes and expectations, to understand why these changes occur, and to evaluate how they relate to consumer decisions to save, to borrow, or to make discretionary purchases under changing conditions.Each survey contains approximately 40 core questions, each of which probes a different aspect of consumer confidence. Open-ended questions are asked concerning evaluations of expectations about personal finances, employment, price changes, and the national business situation. Additional questions probe for the respondents appraisal of present market conditions for houses, and other durables. Demographic data obtained in these surveys include income, age, sex, race, education, and occupation, among others. While many questions designed to measure change in attitudes and behavior are repeated in identical form in each survey, special questionnaire supplements are added to most surveys by outside sponsors on a time share basis. Supplements to the ongoing surveys give sponsors prompt turnaround to survey materials while taking advantage of shared field expenses. When the research task is first undertaken, a maximum amount of time and effort can be spent in developing these survey materials, not in establishing and setting in motion standard sampling and interviewing procedures, questionnaire and code development for standard demographic items, and so forth.Although each survey task is unique in its time requirements, shared time participation on the ongoing Surveys of Consumer Attitudes is an effective and flexible approach for meeting many research needs. Current procedures include production of a fully documented computer data file available for analytic use within 48 hours of the close of interviewing. Within one week of the close of the survey, a report containing tabulations and charts of questions asked is sent to the sponsors.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800275.810925

(Part - I): Information Processing in the Social Sciences and Humanities - Volume 1981,A new process for documenting and checking archival data,"The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) is a data archive and repository for social science data. A major function of the ICPSR is to disseminate the data holdings in a reasonably standard format. For holdings that will be extensively used, additional effort is made to prepare comprehensive, machine-readable documentation, to cross-check the documentation against the data for accuracy and consistency, and to correct or document any inconsistencies discovered.In the past, ""cleaning"" and documenting the data involved using a number of different computer programs. A great deal of human time was expended on procedural matters: which programs to use, when to use them, and how to coordinate the various stages of the cleaning process. As staff costs and the number of new acquisitions skyrocketed, and computers increased in power and decreased in cost, it became imperative to automate as much as possible the procedure for preparing data for distribution. The GIDO software was developed to meet this need.GIDO is an interactive multi-function program package that guides staff members through the procedure for documenting and cleaning social science data. A cohesive history of the processing operations performed on the data is maintained automatically in machine-readable form. Video terminals are used to display ""forms"" which the staff fill out with the textual and technical documentation for the data. GIDO immediately verifies the contents of each form and provides an opportunity to make corrections. The forms allow the input of information without requiring knowledge of specialized syntax and conventions. After all documentary materials have been entered, GIDO checks the data for consistency with the original documentation, corrects or flags discrepancies encountered, reformats the data using uniform conventions, and produces machine-readable documentation in a form ready for dissemination.Use of GIDO enables the ICPSR archive to perform its data processing functions more efficiently and at lower cost, thus permitting the organization to meet ever-increasing demands on its resources.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800275.810926

Computers now help store, manage, duplicate and interpret vast quantities of data with an ease and relative economy undreamed of in the past. These developments have, over the years, fostered the growth of new research methods in a variety of fields, including the social sciences. Large and more complex bodies of quantitative data have been collected as social scientists seek ways to understand human behavior with empirical research methods and scientific sampling techniques. In addition to collecting their own data, researchers have also utilized vast amounts of machine-readable data that have been prepared by other researchers, governmental agencies, and private organizations.The changes in the computing industry combined with the increased demand for services have made it feasible for organizations to consider automating as many tasks as possible.

The May 1981 survey is the 152nd in this series which provides regular assessments of consumer attitudes and expectations. The surveys are designed to explore why changes in consumer attitudes and expectations occur, and how these changes influence consumer spending and saving decisions. A major research objective of the project is to use this collected data to evaluate economic trends and prospects.Each survey contains ""standard"" questions asked at regular intervals, many of which have been included from the project's inception. The aggregated results of these surveys provide a wealth of time-series data with the potential to be an important factor in forecasting consumer behavior. The ""standard"" questions themselves can be disseminated into approximately 190 separate data series (including index transformations). When ""nonstandard"" (or non-core) questions are included, this total jumps considerably. With such a large number of data variables, many different areas of analysis are available to be researched. When the many macro-economic data series (e.g., Federal Reserve, Census, or Retail Sales data) are added to this compilation, the data management problems increase.

It has joined operations research as effective management tools in making substantial impact on optimization of library services, resources sharing and allocation in library networks. With the common belief that humanistic literatures are different, these analytic techniques have not been applied to any extent. We believe that although sociological factors may impact on the humanities in different ways, patterns of regularity in communication, individual contribution, and literature growth shall be studied. Knowledge of the characteristics of humanistic literatures may enable us to improve information access and to maximize available resources in space, manpower, and funds for books. A pilot study has been attempted on a bibliography of the history of the American Revolution.The data base is constructed from the Writings on American History: A Subject Bibliography of Articles under the heading ""Revolution &amp;amp; Confederation (1763-1789)"". To facilitate the analysis, the data management program FAMULUS was used.Selected Results: 1095 articles were published between 1962-1976 by 790 authors in 224 journals or publishing sources. The average author productivity is 1.39 which is similar to other fields studied. As expected, a few highly prolific authors dominated the field, and their productivity distribution follows the well-known Lotka's Law. The dispersion of publications over journals also adheres to Bradford's distribution, identifying the most productive journal in this field as the William and Mary Quarterly. Thus, scholarship in general assumes certain common characteristics regardless of the discipline. Yet differences exist. There are only 77 (10%) authors who have ever co-authored in a mere 47 (4%) of the total literature. This is a dramatic departure from the intensely collaborative enterprise of science in which almost all scientific writers co-author.From our experience, FAMULUS is a useful tool in bibliometric analysis in addition to being a good personal documentation system to replace our shoebox of cards. We have also used it in the teaching of indexing and retrieval of documents.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800275.810933

CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems. (Part - I): Information Processing in the Social Sciences and Humanities - Volume 1981,The text's the thing: Concordances to literary texts (abstract only),"The history of computer-generated concordances is already one-third of a century long. Thousands of concordances have been generated; many have been published. Most of these are useful, but there are limitations to all of them. In this presentation I discuss a number of variations on concordance-making based on specific projects being carried out at the University of Colorado.A word-form concordance can be of considerable utility. Particularly for older states of language of which our knowledge is often less than perfect, this ""primary"" concordance form seems best for initial circulation, but such a concordance is insensitive to variants and ambiguities. It is often as suggestive of what might have been done as it is directly useful.With the increasing availability of microcomputers and various kinds of remote terminals, it is now possible to remove many of the difficulties of text-editing so that a ""secondary"" concordance edited toward particular applications can be produced more readily. At the University of Colorado, at which the majority of humanists who use computers wish to make maximum use of the available technology without becoming computing scientists, I have found it practical to suggest a particular synthesis of batch and interactive computing. This involves the use of a retrieval, concordance-generating, and editing system so modular in design that editorial intervention is practical at many points. This editing makes use of device-dependent text editors of sufficient sophistication that the user perceives little of the technical operation beyond requesting his programs and his text; otherwise he has the freedom of a typewriter coupled to the benefits of a screen for displaying modifications to his text as they are made, whether directly by him or by a variety of programmed functions. Stations built around ""smart"" terminals as well as ""dumb"" terminals with microcomputer and floppy disks are operational.Thus it is now more practical to produce second-generation concordances which more nearly reflect the perceived needs of a scholarly community: words may be (manually) disambiguated by meaning and function, contexts may be edited either to omit extraneous material or insert explanatory matter, and words may be clustered by dictionary or thesaurus. The result is concordances of far greater utility in specific areas and more meaningful statistics.The development of better equipment and new techniques has made it possible to interact more thoroughly with one's text. There is no need for premature data reduction, but rather the encouragement of what I call the ""infinite loop of literary scholarship"": one works with one's texts to produce results which suggesst work to produce more results which suggest still more work .... The newer technology seems to fit the humanist far better than did the old.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800275.810935

(Part - I): Information Processing in the Social Sciences and Humanities - Volume 1981,Art and architecture thesaurus (abstract only),"Designing and providing subject access to works of art has traditionally been very subjective. This is due to the fact that there are no standardized word lists which can be expected to meet the scope of all art collections. Whereas tailoring subject terms to the scope of a given collection is the most practical approach for the curator in charge of the collection, the researcher, who may not be an art specialist, often is frustrated when the listing of subject terms does not include the terms relevant for his/her purposes. This presentation will explore how the development of a thesaurus resolves the conflict of subject vocabulary. Specific examples will be drawn from four computer projects at the National Museum of American Art. Each of the projects varies in scope, yet a single subject classification guide has been developed for purposes of providing subject access to the contents of each project.Because a separate subject word list was not originally designed for each project, a thesaurus is now being developed which will allow for a listing of terms not used for indexing but which are relevant to both the scope of each project and anticipated researcher needs.From a practical viewpoint, the presentation will demonstrate how the computer can be used to generate terminology to be included in the thesaurus.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800275.810939
CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems. (Part - I): Information Processing in the Social Sciences and Humanities - Volume 1981,Folk (abstract only),"Ethnography is a methodology which emphasises a ""soft"" interpretative approach to social reality. It is often portrayed as being at the opposite pole to quantitative approaches as exemplified in the classic Merton-Lazarsfeld paradigm (Structural-Functionalism wedded to the survey method).Ethnography is a method in which the researcher actively engages in and records the life of a social group. This record of experience is essentially qualitative. It is primarily constructed in the form of textual description: an ongoing account of a person's observations, thoughts and feelings while in the ""field"". This text is usually given the generic title of field-notes.The Ethnographic researcher is therefore normally confronted with a vast amount of textual data. To get some understanding of, and control over this data, the Ethnographer must in some way split up this record of raw experience. He must in some way ""chunk"" up his data into easily manageable units or categories. It is this classificatory activity which forms the basis of Ethnographic analysis.In greater detail, Ethnographic data analysis may be generally portrayed as consisting of three analytically distinct, but empirically indistinct activities: represents a1. The reading of field-notes, accompanied by the recording of themes and hypotheses;2. The coding of important topics observed within the field-notes under different category headings;3. The disassembling of field-notes by coded category; the purpose being the creative filing and retrieving of one's data.The prime concern of this presentation will be to discuss means by which such analysis may be accomplished.It is the author's belief that the schema shown below possible evolutionary trend in Ethnographic data analysis: items lower down the schema give the Ethnographer greater power and flexibility in the way he handles text. Reference will be made to presently ongoing research at Cardiff as evidence of this claim.1. The Traditional Filing Cabinet.a. Simple chronological filing of text.b. Multiple filing: the actual disassembling of text into files.2. The Filing cabinet and Separate Indices.a. Chronological filing: card indices.b. Chronological filing: specialised indices.c. Chronological filing: computer indices.3. The Full Computer Approach.a. Indices and fieldnotes stored on UNIX.b. A System of Personalised Interactive Computing for Ethnographers. SPICE: a term purely invented to emphasise the ""spice"" of Ethnographic research.Finally, this presentation will also discuss the implications that this research has for textual management in general. The projected computer arrangement will, I believe, prove of advantage not only to the Ethnographer, but to any researcher who employs continuous text as his/her primary resource.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800275.810940

employment, fertility, demographic and stratification research
involving Public Use Sample (PUS) microdata on the national level,
and (2) applied research (for planning, administration, marketing,
and other applications) with summary (aggregated) data for
localized (i.e., block, tract, community, etc.) geographic units. A
third, highly productive avenue of research, involving Census PUS
micro-data for localized urban units (i.e., SMSAs, counties and
especially selected large-city neighborhoods), has not received the
attention it merits, either among sophisticated public data users
or among novice users.Three forms of current or future small area,
Census microdata constitute resources for urban research. First,
conventional 1970 Census PUS data sets are available for counties
and/or SMSAs (with minimum populations of 250,000). Second, special
tabulations for the two largest U.S. cities permit analysis of 1970
household and person records group by (sub-county) urban
neighborhoods (27 in New York City; 12 in Chicago). Third, 1980
Census microdata, by allowing identification of geographic areas of
smaller population size (100,000 population), will vastly expand
the applications of localized research with the conventional PUS or
special tabulations. In addition, the 1980 PUS microdata will, for
the first time, allow comparative time-series analyses of county
(or SMSA) area populations, over the 1970-1980 decade.In contrast
to national PUS microdata research, local level analyses have the
advantages of (1) smaller data set size and processing costs, (2)
more immediate integration of computerized research hypotheses with
additional sources of (qualitative) information and questions
(stemming from direct knowledge of the communities studied), and
(3) increased ability to zero in on specialized ethnic,
occupational-industrial, migrant, age, etc. urban population groups
which are disproportionately represented in particular local
environments. Our own research projects (at various stages of
development) which attempt to exploit these advantages include
computerized analysis of:1. Patterns of household composition, and
source and structure of family income, among Upper East Side and
Upper West Side Manhattan residents with family incomes of $
50,000. or more (as reported in the 1970 Census)2. Employment
patterns of married women of Cuban immigrant background, in
relation to family class position and period of immigration, for
Hudson County, New Jersey3. Contrasts in the occupational positions
and household patterns of first-generation and second-generation
husbands and wives of Italian background in a New York City working
class community (Astoria-Long Island City, Queens)4. Wives'
employment patterns in relation to ethnic background and husbands'
occupations and income levels in a working class community located
in a manufacturing center (South Side, Chicago)5. Change in the
social and demographic characteristics of succeeding groups of
migrants to an expanding ""sunbelt"" metropolitan area (Albuquerque,
New Mexico)6. Contrasts in local housing markets and housing
availability, involving analysis of the number and characteristics
of vacant housing units for New Jersey counties.These, as well as
other projects we have assisted, have been undertaken with varied
software resources, including packages (such as CENTS-AID) with
unique hierarchical file processing capabilities, as well as more
versatile (non-hierarchical), general purpose packages (such as
SPSS). The advantages and research applications of small area,
micro-databases can be realized with a range of software techniques

CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems. (Part - I): Information Processing in the Social Sciences and Humanities - Volume 1981,Making computer capabilities accessible to musicians (abstract only),"During the past ten years at The Ohio State University we have developed a large library of music-related computer programs, encompassing many aspects of music scholarship. These programs include procedures for performing basic music analysis functions as well as programs for information retrieval. We have also prepared a considerable library of encoded musical data and bibliographic information. All our programs and data are stored on disks on OSU's Amdahl 470, making them immediately accessible to any computer programmer who has been initiated into the mysteries of manipulating disk-stored data sets. We wanted, however, to make everything equally accessible to those musicians who are not particularly interested in mastering the complexities of computers, but who would nevertheless like to make use of computer-produced results. We have taken two significant steps toward solving this difficult problem:1. SLAM (Simple Language for Analyzing Music), a ""super-high-level"" language written in SPITBOL by Thomas G. Whitney (formerly on the staff of OSU's Instruction and Research Computer Center). With SLAM, the musician specifies which music analysis procedures and which musical data he would like to use, communicating with the computer in normal English using traditional music analysis terminology. Though he must satisfy certain syntactical requirements and must include certain key words, such constraints are minimal. For example, ""Please count the intervals in the alto voice of Bach's chorale 308."" and ""Count intervals alto 308."" are both legal SLAM commands which would produce the same results. SLAM translates the user's request into the appropriate job control language statements which call the programs and data necessary to perform the task.2. IRRS (Information Retrieval Request System), written in SPITBOL, currently under development. This system provides access to different types of bibliographic, textual, and descriptive data stored on the computer. The user makes his request in the appropriate format, and the computer executes the steps necessary to produce the requested information. For example, in order to retrieve a bibliography of books and articles written between 1960 and 1970, dealing with the perception of music intervals, the user enters ""keyterm: perception, music intervals"" and ""year: 1960-1970"" from a computer terminal. The terminal then prints a list of books and articles meeting these criteria.SLAM has been very succesful. Not only have the non-computer-programmers found SLAM invaluable, but even our musician-programmers have found it much easier to access existing programs through SLAM. The information retrieval programs are well under way, and we expect them to be equally useful in providing access to research materials. In short, we are achieving our goals: 1) to make available a variety of computer procedures and data to computer-shy musicians and 2) to eliminate the fears, disappointments, and general confusion too often associated with musicians' attempts to use computers.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800275.810945
CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems. (Part - I): Information Processing in the Social Sciences and Humanities - Volume 1981,Requirements for improving the use of computers to support the development of policy decisions (abstract only),"Computer based information systems have been developed and used successfully for production and engineering and for lower level management tasks but they have yet to be widely applied to aiding management decision making at the higher policy making levels. Despite many attempts, the failures have been many and the successes few. This has resulted in large part from the fact that the technicians who have been engaged to design such systems have not correctly understood the nature of the problem environment with which they are dealing. Because they themselves have had no experience at the policy making levels, they have had a poor conception of the problems to be solved, and thus have made mistakes which they would not have made, had they been designing an information system for lower level tasks. In designing an inventory or process control system, for instance, the technicians have carefully studied the nature of the problems to be dealt with, and have decided which information is important and which not. They have not, in these cases, delivered reams of superfluous information to every point in the system. But when designing an information system to aid higher level decision making, they have tended to do the exact opposite. They have attempted to put every conceivable piece of information that could possibly be of the most remote interest at the fingertips of each and every policy maker -- each of whom is already suffering from a severe information overload. The decision maker could never possibly begin to digest all of this information, even if he found it useful, which, in general, he does not. This paper proposes methods for dealing with this crucial inhibiting problem.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800275.810946
CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems. (Part - I): Information Processing in the Social Sciences and Humanities - Volume 1981,On the need for human rationing (abstract only),"The occasion for this discussion is our recent experience with a severe shortfall in computational capacity at The Pennsylvania State University. Although the details of this affliction may not be reproduced elsewhere, it is our opinion that the events we experienced stem from essential, underlying phenomena which do have wide currency. These are, first, that overall demand for computational facilities and services is increasing ""exponentially"" and shows no sign of slowdown, and, second, that resources (most especially including funds) to provide increases in the relevant supply of computing capacities are not keeping pace and can not be expected to do so.It is possible that technical advances can treat this disorder, but in the nature of the political/bureaucratic systems which are the vehicles for the delivery of such ""fixes"", acquiring them will not be painless. Concretely, it seems unlikely that faculty and students in colleges and universities can expect relief from recurrent boom-and-bust in computational resources, whether the duration of such cycles is measured in decades or days. It behooves us to ask whether the attendant pains must be endured, and whether they are conducive to easier and more productive use of computing systems. Our answers are, first, that such pain does not ennoble, and, second, that it often is counterproductive. Consequently, we must try to identify the proximate sources of the disrupting effects of these cyclic shortfalls and attempt to curb them, within our means.We propose that the appropriate guidelines for allocating scarce computing resources may be characterized as prescriptions for humane rationing. In the most general terms, these prescriptions are 1) that qualified users should be ensured a fair share of the available resource without unnecessary expenses of effort in competition for them and in queuing, and 2) that use of computing resources should be so governed as to insure that all user sessions are as free as possible of delays, encumbrances, and constraints induced by management practices rather than by inherent limits of hard and software.While rationing is unnecessary during the occasional boom in academic computing resources, we should have on the shelf the management tools which can make fair and effective allocation possible during the recurrent busts we may anticipate in the 1980's.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800275.810947

CHI '81: Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Easier and More Productive Use of Computer Systems. (Part - I): Information Processing in the Social Sciences and Humanities - Volume 1981,Combining database management and statistical subroutinesunto a user-oriented data analysis facility (abstract only),"Most database management systems (DBMS) offer convenient and flexible data structures and very good data maintenance facilities. At the same time their data manipulation languages are usually limited and most data analysis applications require extensive programming in a host language. On the other hand, the packages of statistical subroutines (PSS) usually have very good data manipulation and analysis facilities, while at the same time they lack the well known advantages of DBMS. An attempt was made to combine the data definition and maintenance facilities of DBMS and the data manipulation and analysis facilities of PSS into a single user-oriented system. The additional software developed for this purpose performs the following functions:1. Allows the user to define his own analysis and (optionally) store it in a library for further reference.2. Allows the user to define the data on which analysis is to be performed.3. Allows the user to execute the (predefined) analysis in the following way:a. the user's description of analysis is translated into a sequence of data analysis and/or data manipulation subroutines of PSS.b. the required data are retrieved from a database under the control of DBMS and put into a temporary file, whose structure is determined by the analysis input requirements.c. the analysis is performed under the control of the executing program PSS.The outlined system is now being implemented, as an interdepartmental effort, in The Institute for Organization of the Medicine Industry, Warsaw, Poland. It utilizes IMS/VS as a database management system and the OSIRIS III package for statistical data processing. Although the system is still under development it is used not only by research workers but also by administrators and management for relatively simple analysis which are not routinely performed, standard reports. The main advantages of the outlined approach can be summarized as follows:a. reduction of time and cost of preparing the analysis,b. increasing the reliabilityc. presenting the tool for the actual decision makers to perform their own data analysis without the interference with programmers.",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800275.810950
